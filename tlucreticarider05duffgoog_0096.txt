70 LUCRETmS, 111.

nuum, common in negative sentences (cf. l. 518), is very rare in an
affirmative sentence. Lucr. has only one other instance (iv 515).

515. quicumque adoritur refers to the physician.

mouture cf. Ennius seu mortuu’ sive moriture adoritur is never
found.

516. naturam, ⁸ organism.’

519, 520. ⁴ Whenever a thing changes and quits its proper limits,
at once this change of state is the death of that which was besore':
i.e. a thing is what it is in virtue of certain characteristics (fines) which
make it what it ise if it loses these characteristics, it ceases to exist.
In the present case, sickness of the soul implies change and therefore
death3 but exactly the same is true of healing.

Lucr. states this dogma twice elsewhere (i 670, ii '75 3) and evidently
attaches much importance to it. No doubt he found it in EpicurnS.
It states the. main result of the Eleatic philosophy, and denies the
transformation theories of the Ionic philosopherS, who believed that the
ἀρχή (or primary substance os matter) could be transformed: e.g. that
water might be the ἀρχή and yet could, by transformation, produce fire.
The Eleatics asserted the immutability of substance.

521—525. This is the summing-up of all the five arguments con-
tained in the paragraph.

524. occurrere, ‘to confront.' The false theory can neither
advance nor retreat with safety, as the disproof has two sideS, one
bearing on the sickness of the soul, the other on its cure.

eunti is=abeunti= cf. l. 526. .

526—547 are placed in the text aster 6692 see n. there.

548—557. The mind is an organ os sensatim, like the eye, ear, or
hand,- andjust as these', when separated from the body, lose their
powers and decay, so the mind cannot extis-t apart from the body.

We have here, and shall have again, the argument which Lucr.
only hinted at in ll. 323—349, that the body is causa salutis to the
soul.

548. The special location of the mind within the body is not of
importance to the present argument: the argument founded upon this
fact comes l. 615 foll.

550. munus, ‘organs of sense': see n. to l. 626.

551. manus is the organ of touch: Lucr. is not speaking merely of
parts of the body (or he might have instanced crus or pes) but of

organs of sensation.
