NOTES. 77

This argument, like the last, is based upon the fact that the soul is
broken up within the body; the only difference is that, in the case of the
man mutilated in battle, death did not necessarily follow.

¹ (Ι have followed Giussani in transposing this paragraph for the follow·
ing reasons: (1) the argument it contains has no relation to that
contained either in 510—525 ‘or in 548 --579. Here it is in close
relation with what immediately precedes it. (2) The words ut diximus
ante (l. 538) refer most naturally to ll. 588 soll. Without transposition,
they must refer toll. 531, 5323 but, when the distance is so short, the
reference seems unnecessary.

Another possible place for the paragraph would be after i. 614.)

526. 1r0,‘ pass away’: cf. 1. 594.

527. The rhythmis very unusual. elsewhere' m Lucr. two spondees

at the beginning of the verse are always followed by a monosyllable, “J ¹
e. g. tmmortalz' sunt. Here the staccato rhythm, due to the lack of ¹ .— ¹

caesura, suggests the dying of one limb after another.

his feet: 1 put my hand into the bed and felt them, and they were
as cold as any stone3 then I felt to his knees and they were as cold
as any stone, and so upward and upward, and all was as cold as
any stone.’

529. post and inde are identical in meaning.

531. ‘Therefore (hoo), since the soul is torn asunder and passes
away....'

hoc (abl.) is=ergo, and has this meaning often,' e.g. iv 658, 1093,
though it generally comes earlier in the sentence.

532. sincera, ‘entire ἐ cf. incolumem l. 608.

534. parus, ‘its parts.’

537. in sensu madore, ‘in possession of more lively sensation ἐ
i.e. if the soul withdraws from the dying limbs and concentrates at the
heart, then the mental powers of a dying man ought to increase in pro·
