NOTES. 8 5

772. There seems to be a mixture of two constructions: quid sibi
vult cum exit? and quare vult exire? Lucr. does not answer his
question 3 but his point is that the soul does not, as the believers in
metempsychosis think, leave the body but perishes with it.

senectia: this adj. is common in early Latin, and the fem. is used
freely as a noun by the Augustan poets.

773. 1f the soul is immortal and therefore cannot be destroyed, why
should it not go on indefinitely inhabiting the same body, even if the
body is decayed?

metult...ma.nere: the inf. aster metuere is a poetical constr. only.

pun-1, ‘ crumbling.'

774. domus: for the metaphor, cf. Gorgias (Thompson's ed. p. 184)
ὥσπερ ἐκ σαπροῦ καὶ ῥέοντος συνοικίου ἀσμένως ἀπαλλάττομαι. Waller,
‘ The soul's dark cottage, batter’d and decay’d, Lets in new light
thro’ chinks that time has made.’

spatio vetusto=vetustate2 cf. Arist. Frogz· 347 ἔτη παλαιά.

776-783. [f the soul enters the body from without, are we to suppose
that itis always looking out for· a body to inhabit, and that there is a
fierce competition between soulsjbr each body, and an eager struggle to

get there first ἲ But perhaps there is an honourable understanding
between them, that ‘first come, first served.’ ·

776. conubia Veneris, ‘ sexual unions ἐ this seems to apply to
human beings‚ as partun is here restricted to animals.

778. immortalia, sc. animas.

780. potissima, ‘ by preference’= the adv· is commonerz but cf.
Livy v ια, 12 nec satis. constat cnr primus. ac potissimus ad novum
delibandum honorem sit habitus.

781. 81 non forte, ironical, like nisi forte in Cicero.

782. volun, ‘ in its flight.’ Ι

Lucr. is thinking of a great crowd of human beingS, each of whom is
trying his baet to squeeze in and get a place at some public show.

784—805. Every kind os thing has an environment proper to itself, in ·
which alone it can live.- the environment os the animus is the body.
And, more than that, even in the body itself it has a fixed, permanent
abode. Τ herefore the soul cannot exist outside tlte body. It is
impossible to suppose that an immortal soul and a mortal body could
be joined in so close a union.
