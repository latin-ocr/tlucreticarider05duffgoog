100 LUCRETIUS‚ 111.

956. marceo refers here to physical decay only= cf. l. 946.

957. A regular reproach of ancient moralists: cf. Pind. issa. 3, 20
ἤρατο τῶν ἀπεόντων, ota καὶ πολλοὶ πάθονε Thuc. vi 13 δυσέρωτας εἶναι
τῶν ἀπόντων.

958. tibi elapsast, ‘has slipped from your grasp!

960. plenus rerum, ‘filled with good things’= ef. 1. 1004.

961. tamen, i.e. although not satur ac plenus.
⁰ 962. agedum (or age) sharpens an imperative: quaeso or amabo
sostens it. .

gnatis: so Bernays for mag-nis of Mss.: concede seems to require
a dat.: a new generation pushes out the old 3 and the old must make a
virtue of necessity.

Another likely emendation is magnus, ‘like a man,’ for which
Munro quotes Sen. Epp. 110, 18 illam vocem magnus atque animosus

963. agat, ‘she would bring her charge ’z a technical phrase of the

govern the abl.

968. vita perfuncta, ‘ when they have ended their term of life’:
sor an acc. afterfungi, cf. l. 956.

969· ante· rs the adv. ,,

haee is obscure. it cannot refer to postera saecla, as the tense of
cecidere ι5 unsuitable. it seems to stand for saecla generally, as if postera
had been sorgotten.

971. ‘Life is given to no man in perpetuity but to all men to enjoy
