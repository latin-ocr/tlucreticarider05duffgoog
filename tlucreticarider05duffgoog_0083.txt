sense of infra cf. iv 112, where it is said of atoms generally, sunt infra
nostros sennes.

276-281. These lines explain the phrase anima est animae: they
completely upset the theory, adopted by many, that the quarta natura
is confined to the animus. As, says Lucr., the soul permeates the
whole body but, being made of small atoms, is elusive, so the quarta
natura permeates the whole soul (and therefore the body), but is elusive
sor the same reason: thus it is to the soul what the soul is to the body.

281 . dominatur corpore toto, ‘ is of paramount importance through·
out the whole body.’ The same phrase was used (1. 138) of the
animu53 and for this reason the erroneous inference has been drawn
that the quarta natura is confined to the animus.

The dominium of the anima is an effective occupatiori of the whole
body; the dominium of the animus is rule carried on from a central
position. ’

282. consimili rationo: just in the same way the three other
substances are inextricably mixed up with one another.

283. oommixta: neut. plur.: see n. to 1. 66: the emphasis falls
on this word, not on wgeant.

284. ‘And that one should be (continually) more concealed or more
prominent than another': i.e. all are equally concealed and equally
prominent. Lucr. is trying to express a very difficult notion. He seems
to mean ε as the quarta natura hides behind the other three, owing to
its composition,- so each of them is constantly hiding behind the otherS,
with the result that no one is more prominent than any other.

aliis may be either dat. after subsit or abl. after magis.

(Munro gives a different explanation of the 1., i.e. aliud aliis magis
subsit in hac re, magis emineat in illa re. To this there seem two
objectionsz (1) that a change of text in 1. 288 <etenim for etiam) is
required 3 (α) that ut must then have the limiting or restricting sense
which is confined to ita ut.)

285. unum, ‘a single substance.'

286. ni has here the sense of ne ε so nive ii 734.

seorsum implies hostility: the word is scanned as a dissyllable.

287. dicium, ‘ by their separation from one another.’

288—322. 77ae first three component parts ‘ff the soul may be seen in
(ι) states qf mind, (α) temperaments: anger is the sign os the
warmth, sear qf the wind, tranquillity qs the air. As the lion is
fierce, the stagsrzjglztened, and the ox placid, so there are diffirmces
