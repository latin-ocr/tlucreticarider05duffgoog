44 LUCRETms, 111.

relative clause itself contains the definition. We should therefore expect
attraction in all the three caseS. Perhaps the relative is influenced by
the juxta-position of the predicate or antecedent, i.e. mentem quam,
consilium quod.

95. eonsilium vitae regimenque, ‘the principle of reason which
directs our lise’: Lucr. seems to be translating τὸ λογικόν and τὸ
ἡγεμονικόν, terms which were technically used sor the rational part of the
soul-

96. nominis is emphatic: for the rational part of the soul is not
found 111 the lower animals.

ac has the sense of quam, after the comparative: cf. l. 1093.

97. A line has here fallen out of the Mss.: the sense must have
been: ‘ yet some philosophers have held that....’

98. Whereas Epicurus taught that intellectual activity was confined
to the animus, and that the animus was confined to a particular part
of the body, i.e. the heart 3 cf. 1. 140.

99. habitum-corporis, ‘there is a condition of the body which
produces lise.'

100. harmoniam: the view that the soul was merely the result of
a given state of body, was widely held in antiquity: it is stated by
Simmias in Plato's Phaedo 85 133 it is identified especially with two
pupils of Aristotle, Aristoxenus and Dicaearchus. Of these the latter
said that the soul μηδὲν εἶναι παρὰ τό πως ἔχειν τὸ σῶμαε the former
was a musician, and Lucr. seems (cf. 1. 132) to have had him chiefly in
his mind. As this theory of course implies the mortality of the soul, one
might have expected Lucr. to view it with more indulgence.

101. vivere oum sensu, ‘ to possess life and sensation.'

nulla. in parte, ‘in no definite part ’ of the body: cs. 1. 104.

103. valentis: the only instance in Lucr. where valere: ‘ to be

' well ’z elsewhere it=‘ to be able.’

105. diversi, ‘in more ways than one!

106. itaque refers back to the statement in ll. 96, 97: all that
comes between is parenthetical.

This is the first argument to prove that the operations of the mind ’

are independent of those of the body; the second argument begins
at l. 112.

107. The pars latens is the animus.

108. ‘ And conversely (retro) it osten happens on the other hand
(vicissim) that the contrary is the case.'

113. effusum: a graphio expression: cs. Spenser Facrie Quaene
