68 LUCRETIUS, 111.

467. undo, ‘from which,' is more expressive of remoteness than
ubi, ‘in which,’ would be.

471. quandoqmdem explains quare here, as nam explains it
l. 472.

474, 475 of the MSS. are a senseless interpolation, first struck out
of the text by Naugerius in his edition of 1515 A.D.

476. Lucr. regards drunkenness and epilepsy as affecting the soul
primax-ily, though they are attended by physical symptoms.

479. madet mena, ‘his' mind is besotted ’: madere, in this sense,
is generally said of the man himself.

480. singultus seems to denote the maudlin stage of inebriety, as
clamor and iurgia denote the noisy and quarrelsome stages respec-
tively.

gnaeum, ‘ run high’z cf. iv 1069 gliscit suror3 v 1061 gaudia
gliscunt.

481. et iam cetera: see n. to l. 390. There are other results of
intoxication (cf. Cic. Phil. ii 63), which Lucr. declines to specify.

483. corpore in ipso, ‘ within the body ἐ {pso throws emphasis 011
in: the phrase recurs several times below: see n. to l. 506.

484. inquo poturi: see n. to conque putrescunt l. 343.

486. aevo=vita.

487. He next describes the symptoms of epilepsy, morbus comi-
tialis, so called because an epileptic seizure occurring during the comitia
was taken as an evil omen, so that the meeting carne sorthwith to an
end.

489. attus: the acc. of reference, common in· all Latin poetry.

492. Lucr. now begins to explain the symptoms: the symptom‚
which really concerns his present argument, begins with l. 499.

quia vis morbi cet., ‘ because the force of the disease, spread (Ρ)
through his srame, disorders him,·he foams at the mouth....'

But it seems probable that at least one 1. is lost after this verse, as
distracta is often in the immediate sequel applied to the soul (cf.11. 501,
507, 590, 799), but has no meaning when applied to vis morbi. distracta
cannot be corrupt, because of the reference-to it below (l. 500). If the
lacuna be granted, Brieger's vi morbi is a probable emendation.

493. agens animam, ‘trying to eject his soul ἐ cf. l. 505. animam
agere generally means ‘to breathe one’s last,’ but cannot mean quite
this here.

The subject of spumat is the sick man.

495. exprimitur, ‘is wrung from him.'
