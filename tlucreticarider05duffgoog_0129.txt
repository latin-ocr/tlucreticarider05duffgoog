No‘rEs. 103

1010. expleri...potestur= cf. i 1045 suppleri...queatur: in each
case the passive is due to the passive inf. which precedes: 80, with
a passive inf„ coeptus sum and desitus sum are regularly used sor coepi

and desii.
1011. After this 1. Munro marks a lacuna sor two reasons: (1) the

subjects have no verb3 (τ) it is strange that Ixion's wheel should be
omitted in au enumeration of this kind3 and we know from Servius
(on Virg. Aen. vi 596) that he did find Ixion mentioned in this passage,
and compared to traders who risk their lives at sea. Consequently

some verses have been lost.
(Logicany, Ixion ought to come after the Danaids and before Cerberus

and the F uries, as he is a type and not merely a terror. It is possible
that there is a lacuna of several ll. aster 1010, and of one 1. after 1011:
so Giussani.)

1012. aestus, ‘fires’= hell is represented as a sort of volcano in

popular belief.
1013. qul: the antecedent is not aestus but Tartarus and other

legendary terrors „mentioned in the lost verses·

1014. tn vita: cf. ll. 979, 982.
1015. insigms may have a bad meaning as well as a good.

1016. carcer is the Mamertine prison, robur the dungeon added to Ι.

it by Servius Tullius and known as Tullianum, saxum the Tarpeian
rock from which criminals were thrown.

1017. The pitch‚ the metal plateS, the fite-brands, are all instru-
ments of torture.

1018. abt is to be taken both with conscia and with adhibet.

1021. quae: finis is always fem. in Lucr.

10²3· ‘Here, on earth, in short, the life of fools becomes a hell’:
for this meaning of hic, cs. l. 992.

1024—1052. Think how many great men and heroes os old have died:
would you then claim to escape death, you whose life is little moro
than a living death, like sleey> or drunkenness, and is made unhappy
by causes you a'o not understand?

The names that follow reach a climax in the mention of Epi-
curus: first come kings and generalS‚ then poets and philosopherS, then
Democritus and last the greatest of all philosopher&

1024. tute: the suffix seems to be used with no other pronoun:

· the plur. is vosmet. Lucr. also uses tutemet.

102 5. The line comes from Ennius·
