1555 ung-uam, ⁸ the voice.’
156. sonere: again l. 8733 an archaic form.

158. The summing-up shows the gist of the whole paragraph, that
the animus and anima form in fact a single substance.

161—176. Thes-e mutual relations between the soul and body prove that
the animus and anima are material. For the relations are produced

by contact,· and nothing which is not material can either touch or
be touched.

According to Epicurus everything that exist3‚ with the single ex-
ception of Void, is material, i.e. formed of atoms. Lucr. here reproduces
the argument of Epicurus about the soul (Usener l. l. p. τὴς οὶ λέγοντες
ἀσώματον εἶναι τὴν ψυχὴν ματᾴζουσιν. οὐθὲν ’γὰρ ἂν ἐδύνατο ποιεῖν οὔτε
πάσχειν, εἰ ἦν τοιαύτη · νῦν δ’ ἐναργῶς ἀμφότερα ταῦτα συμβαίνει περὶ
τὴν ψυχὴν τὰ συμπτώματα.

161. ratio, ‘ principle': the reference is to propellit et icit l. 160:
Ι cf. propellere l. 162.

naturam amml=animumt see 11. tol. 130.

162. ubl, ‘since.’ .

163. mutareque vultum: cf. Hamlet 11 ας ‘this player here Could
sway his soul so to his own conceit, That from *her working all his
visage wanned.'

164. versate, ‘turn in different directions.’

videtur, not ‘ seems to,' but ‘ clearly does'z videor is very osten a
true passive in Lucr. and refers to the φαινόμενα, 01· things obvious to the
senses, which were to Epicurus the foundation of all knowledge and ’the
final court of appeal in the search for truth: see Introd. p. ix.

166. Cf. i 443 facere et fimgi sine corpore nulla potest res: the soul
does both and therefore is body.

168. praeterea: the soul not only acts upon the body but is also
acted upon. fungi=rdoxec=5 and serves as a passive of facere. There
is συμπάθεια (see n. to 1. 153) between body and soul as there is
between the parts of the soul.

170—174. A bodily injury will in some casoe destroy life; and even
when it does not actually do this, the symptoms that follow a not fatal
wound, show how the soul is acted upon by the body.

171. intus does not go with adacta: for this, intro would be
requiredt ‘ when the bones and sinews within are laid bare.'

adacta belongs properly to teli rather than to vis.
