76 LUCRETIUS, 111. .
χ ,

648. romono: cf. i 560, iv 976. The convenient form reliquus
(ww) is used only by the post-Augustan pects, first by Persius: in '
Plautus the scansion is re'li‘cffils: Lucr. lengthens th'e first syllable (as in
relligio) and so can use it in his verse. Virgil, Horace, and Ovid never
use the word at all, prevented by the three short syllables with which it
begins.

pateam, ‘seeks to engage in’ :the subjectis homo understood.

649. neo tenet.. ωηερε ‘and often does not notice)

·65ο. abuma: cf. consumpse i 233, protraxe v ¹159·

rotas meosque, ‘the wheels armed with scythes': cf. v 516 rotas
atque haustra, ‘the wheels provided with scoop5.'

651. scandit, i.e. in the attempt to mount the chariot and kin the
driver.

653. propter, ⁸ hard by.’

655. voltum vitalem, ‘the expression os life!

657, 658. The reading is not certain3 but Giussani’s truncum (for
utrumque of uss.) seems to make the lacuna unnecessary. To serpentis
are added three ablatives of description, which reser to the long body of
the snake, and the flickering tongue and darting tail at the two ends.

utrumque can hardly be right: it would mean, ‘the tongue and the
tail’. but it ‘is not supposed that the tongue is cut.

659. sit unitum perhaps carries a playful implication that this
would be a dangerous fancy..

662. ‘And the front part with the mouth making for its own hinder
part’ = partem is subject, ipsam se object.

663. promtu assuage!

tcta has been objected to as otiose: but cf. Mart. ii 66, 4 cecidit
saevis icta Plecusa comis.

dolorem governs voluens.

664. totae...an:lmas, ‘ entire souls.'

666. unam: animans in Lucr. (see n. to 1. 57 3) is feminine. it is an
adj. agreeing perhaps with natura understood.

The idea that one body could contain many souls is tacitly rejected
as an absurdity.

526—547. We often see a man die by inches: This shows that the soul
is torn in pz'eces within the body and is therefore mortal. Experimce
refutes the hypothesis that before death the soul gradually concontrates

in one part of the body ,· and, even if we grant the hypofhesis, it will
still follow that the soul is morlal.
