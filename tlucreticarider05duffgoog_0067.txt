17. discedunt, ‘ part asunder’: a rare sense of the word.

inane=⁴ro κενόν and is a noun. The eye of reason can see the
processes of nature, i.e. the constant making and unmaking of worldS‚
going on (geri) throughout the universe, and can also see the invisible
swarm of atoms flying to and fro in all directions, Though inane
strictly means ‘space where there are no atom5,' it can also be used, and
is used here, for the whole of space including the atomS, and bodies
formed of atomS, within it.

18. divum numen, ‘the holy gods.’ The following lines are a
translation of the Homeric description of Olympus, Od. vi 42 οὔτ’
ἀνέμοισι τινάσσεται, οὔτε, ποτ’ ὄμβρῳ Ι δεύεται, οὔτε χιὼν ἐπιπίλναται ·
ἀλλὰ μάλ’ αἴθρη Ι πέπταται ἀνέφελος λευκὴ δ’ ἐπιδέδρομεν αἴγλη.

22. ridet: Lachmann changed this to rident, sedes being supplied
as subject: he says: ‘ridere dicuntur quae illustrantur, non quae
illustrant.’ But the MS. reading is, Ι think, defended by i 9 nitet deffuso
lumine caelum.

24„ This peace of the gods, which nothing impairs at any time, is
only possible on condition that they have nothing to do with the affairs
of men. This is one of the most important doctrines of Epicurus.

25. Acherusia templa, ‘the realm of Acheron,’ i.e. hell, the
place where the wicked suffer after death. Popular superstition repre·
sented this as beneath the earth; but Lucr., who with the mind's eye can
penetrate through the earth, sees that there is no hell there.

templa is used freely in old Latin in the sense of loca: Lucr. has
linguai templa (iv 624) ‘the mouth,' mentis templa (v 103); Plautus
speaks of the sea as Neptunia templa (Mil. Glor. 413).

26. nec...obstat‚ ‘and yet the earth does not hinder.’

28. his rebus, ‘because of these things) ’

1b1 refers back to l. 14: when Epicurus begins to explain the laws of
Nature, thereupon Lucr. is filled with ecstasy and awe at the beatific
vision thus revealed.

·29. percipit, ‘takes hold upon': again 1. 80: Cicero would rather
say percipio voluptatem.

natura here stands for the universe, perhaps also for the laws that
govern it.

31—93. T lte object of this book is to explain the nature ol the soul and
so to drive out that sear of death and a future state which darkens
human life. Many pretend to feel no such sear ; but their conduct
