96 LUCRETIUS‚ 111.

901. super, ‘also': cf. l. 672.

tibi madet, ‘is in thy heart.'

una: the meaning is apparently that together with the joys of life,
all desire for them is gone. But this is strangely expressed3 and
Giussani may be right in reading ullum.

902. metisque sequantur, ‘ and make their words (of mourning)
correspond to it.’

904--908 are either an inconsistent addition to the former lament,
or the words of another mourner who takes quite a different view
from the first, i. e. that the dead man is happy and enviable but has lest
eternal grief to those who survive.

904. quidem ut: for the elision, cf. l. 339.

aevi quod superest, ‘for all remaining time.’

906. The body has been reduced to ashes on the pyre amid the
·tears of the mourners‚ before this lament is spoken.

cinefactum seems to have the sense of cing‘ffcatum, and to be formed
by salse analogy from such words as tumqfactum and madefizctum.

prope=‘standing by’: lit. ‘from close at hand.’

907. insatiabiliter is imitated by Horace Epp. i 14, 7 rapto de

fratrc dolentis Ι insolabzliter. -The rhythm of this ..vei-se, composed of
three w01·,ds is unusual.

909. ab hoo. ln‘c‘ is the second mourner who has just spoken. The
mention of the person serves sor inverted commas here, as addunt (l. 900)
does after the first speech.

910. res redit ad, ‘the result is’: redit is idiomatic and has no sense
of ‘returning’: cf. v 1141 res ad fitecem...redibat.

somnum refers back to sopitus, l. 904.

911. eur=ut ob eam rem.

919-—930 were transposed to this place by Susemihl. It is obvious
that they come in well here, whereas after l. 918 the connexion is hard
to see. It might be possible to mak'e a connexion thus: the dead man
feels desire for nothing: sor in sleep we desire nothing: therefore still
less in death. But 1 believe the transposition to be necessary and right.

919, 920. Lucr. argues: ‘You admit that death is a sleep: well, in
sleep we feel no sense of distress or privation.’

919. se vitamque: when sound asleep, we are dead to sels and life
but do not miss thern. ,

920. mens: the mind may wake when the body sleeps (cf. ll. 112
—116); but in the present case the sleep is very sound, and the mind
shares it. sopita refers to real sleep.
