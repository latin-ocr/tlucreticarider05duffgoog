nares is to be noticed: Lucr. substitutes it for aures (l. 549),

552. amna: neut. plur.: see n. to semota l. 66.

553. tamen, ‘at any rate': i.e. the parts may exist for a time, but
the time will be short.

liquuntur tabe, ⁸ waste away in putrefaction.'

5 5 5. quod refers to corpore, of which §oso homine is an explanation.

556, 557. Lucr. says in effect: ‘the image of the vas is not really
satisfactory because a vessel is not united with its contentS, whereas the
body is ‘closely united' with the mind: therefore invent, if you can,
a better illustration. ⁹.

558—575: 592—606: 576—-579. The same is true of the whole soul.
Both the animus and the anima need the shelter of the body to perform
their functions ,· and when the bodily form is dissolved by death,
lifle and thought come to an end. Even in cases where death does not

· magma intervenis: abl. of attendant circumstances.

569. mevenni-...motus is an imitation of κινοῦνται κινήσειςε cf.
Epic. (Usener l. l. p. αι) οὐ γὰρ οἶόν τε νοεῖν τὸ αἰσθανόμενον, μὴ ἐν
τούτῳ τιὸ συστήματι καὶ ταῖς κινήσεσι ταύταις χρώμενον, ὅταν τὰ στεγά-
