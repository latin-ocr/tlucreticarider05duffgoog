vi PREFACE

before his death in 1900, deserves even higher praise.
Of all the scholars who have devoted themselves to Lucre-
tiuS, none has excelled Giussani in acuteness of intellect
and independence of judgment3 and it is certain that his
influence will long be felt in this department of study.

To all these scholam, and especially to Munro and
Giussani, 1 am deeply indebted, and that not only on
passages where their names are cited. The points on
which original views are put forward are few and un-
important.

I have again to thank Mr W. T. Lendrurn of Gonville
and Caius College for much valuable assistance, given both
in revision of the proof·sheets and in previous discussion
‘of difficult passages in a writer whom we both revere as
one of the choice and master spirits of antiquity.
