62 LUCRETIUS, 111.

exorm prima=primord122.

Giussani acutely points out that most of the following examples seem
not to agree with the rule given. A spider's web, for instance, must,
owing to its length, touch many atoms of soulz it is much larger than
the point of a needle‚ to which atoms of the soul respond readily enough.
In this case the important clement is lightness (cf. l. 387), not smallneSS.
It seems likely that, ‘according to EpicuruS, there are no atoms of soul
on the absolute sul-face of the body, so that a very light object, even
if of some length, touches atoms of the body only, whereas a heavier
object, by carrying its impression deeper, does reach atoms of the soul.
And 1 think Lucr. may have intended to express this here: in fact,
the intervalla are not of superficies, but of profundity.

38²· incussam creta-m has generally been explained by the use
of creta as a cosmetic. Giussani thinks that there is a reference to a
practical joke of street-boys (see 11. to 1. 196) who, unperceived, strike
people on the back with an object marked with chalk3 but surely
vestibus would be needed then, not membris.

383. mel. the last two syllables coalescet aranea is the common
form of the word. The‘ withered garment' of the spider is her web.
cf. Prop. iv 6, 33 putris aranea.

386. pappos, ‘thistle- down?

387. gravam· not tightly: i.e. ‘with difficulty,' is said in playful
contrast with levitate.

389. priva, ‘ separate,'=singula: cf. 1. 372.

390. et cetera is an euphemism: cf. 1. 481 ε Lucr. declines to
mention pulices, cimices and even more disgusting little creatures; but,
he hints at them.

391—393. ‘ So many things must be stirred up within uS, before the
atoms of the soul, scattered throughout the frame in our bodies, perceive
that atoms (of the body) have been struck ’z i.e. the shock, that a touch
imparts to atoms of the body, must be considerable, before it can reaeh
atoms of the soul and- so produce sensation.

391. multa certainly refers to atoms of the body; but it is doubtful
whether it is necessary to make it agree with primordia (so Munro) in
the next l.

392. primm-ma is acc„ semina. is nom. and subject to sentiscant. 2

394. quamn his: for the hiatus, cf. 1. 1082.

tn ms intervallis, ‘being separate as Ι have said ' in 1. 380.

tuditantia: a true frequentative ε the atoms strike and strike again
against each other.
