NOTEs. 5 3

239, 240. ‘Since the mind does not allow that any of these substances
can produce the motions that cause sensation, far less the thoughts
which it ponders in itself’: i. e. warmth, wind, and air cannot be sup·
posed to produce sensation, and much less to produce thought.

The expression is peculiar and seems to be ironical: the mind is
represented as debating its own composition, much as the atoms (ii 978)
are imagined as discussing theirs. The text of 1. 240 is uncertain:
quaedam of Mss- has probably intruded from the next La for mens
Munro reads res, ‘the facts of the case do not admit... .'

mente=secum.

242. By saying that this substance was nameleSS, Epic. meant that
we know no substance so fine that we can suppose it made of atoms
as line as those of the quarta natura.

249. viscera—omnia, ‘ every part os the flesh thrills with sensation.‘
In Lucr. viscera never means ‘entrails ’ but always ‘ flesh,’ all that
comes between the skin and bone: and this meaning is common in old
Latin: cf. Plaut. Mil. Glor. 30 per corium, per vescera, Ι perque os
elephanti transmineret bracchium.

250. The marrow is the last to feel, because it is shut up in the
boneS, and the sensation must reach them first. ,

251. ardor, ‘excitement,' ‘emotion.'

252. huc, i-e. in medullas, a vital part, hence called αἰών. Lucr.
notes how seldom· sensation reaches the marrow; such a hurt must
prove mortal.

(This is Heinze’s explanation. Munro and others explain huc
as=ad quartam naturam3 but the context shows clearly that every
