might befal us in the future.

There is another argument which might seem natural in the
mouth of an Epicurean—the argument of Horace,

Flores amoenae ferre iube rosae,
Dum res et aetas et sororum

stila trium patiuntur atra1,

and of Omar,

‘ Ah, make the most of what remains to spend‚
, Before we too into the Dust descend,
Dust unto Dust, and under Dust to lie,
Sans Wine, sans Song, sans Singer, and—sans End.’

But Lucretius does not believe that the only serious business of
life is sensual pleasure, and will not say, ⁶ Let us eat and drink,
for to-morrow we die! To his austere and noble nature this
argument made no appeal, and he only mentions it to dismiss
it with contempt ².

⁴What then does Lucretius say? He can promise no heaven
hereafter3 but he tells men that if they have nothing to hope,
they have also nothing to fear, beyond the grave.

It cannot be doubted that in the life-time of Lucretius the
great majority of his countrymen believed in some form of

Juvenal in a later age, he ridicules the terrors of the Greek
mythology⁴, is firmly convinced of the soul's immortality. But
