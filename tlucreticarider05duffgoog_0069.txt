NOTES. 41

ἄνευ φυσιολογίας ἀκεραίους τὰς ἡδονὰς ἀπολαμβάνειν. All science is to
Epicurus a meanS, not an end.

41. quod, ‘as to the fact that,' may be translated by ‘when.'

The apodosis begins at 1. 46.

42. Tartara Leti: also Virg. Georg. iv 481: the gen. is possessive:
Death lives in Tartarus and possesses it.

43. animae: dative: ‘the soul has the nature of blood,·’ i-e. the
blood is the soul. 'The persons here spoken of are not philosophers of
any school: they profess to be free-thinkerS, but they have no scientific
grounds for their belief and adopt at caprice (voluntas), as Lucr. says
with scorn, one opinion or another on this matter.

45. nostra. ratio is the Epicurean philosophy.

46. ωηατ-ἐκ τῶνδε, ‘from what follows ' in 11. 48— 54.

laudis, ‘ ostentation.’

47. res, ‘the fact’ that death is not the worst of evils

48—50. A striking commentary on these lines is afforded by
Cicero’s correspondence during his exile. Atticus was an Epicuream
and Lucr. may have seen some of the letters addressed to him.

50. demque, ‘in short.’

vivunt, ‘they go on living,' though they ought on their own
principles to put an end to their lives·

51. tamen, i.e. in spite of their pretended belief.

52. mgras pecudes: black victims were offered to the dead and to
the infernal gods 3 the devotions of these men are paid in all three cases
to personages whose existence they profess to disbelieve.

53. mittunt, ‘offer 'z for mittere, ‘to give away‚’ used without a
dat„ see n. to Juv. 3, 45.

55. spectare, ‘to test.’

58. ree, ‘the reality,’ i.e. a cowardly dread of death.

59. demque, ‘further'z so often iu Lucr. This new point is not
easy to follow: it is not obvious that sear of death is the cause of avarice
and ambition. It has been noticed, e. g. by ThucydideS, that morality
is relaxed in times of epidemic disease3 but Lucr. is not thinking of
exceptional circumstances. He is merely reproducing the view of
EpicuruS‚ who derived these passions from an excess of prudence: e.g. a
man desires money in order to escape poverty, the extreme consequence
of poverty being starvation: cf. Epicurus (Usener l. l. p. 73) ἔνδοξοι καὶ
περίβλεπτοί τινες ἐβουλήθησαν γενέσθαι, τὴν ἐξ ἀνθρώπων ἀσφάλειαν (cf.
stabili 1. 66) οὕτω νομίζοντες περιποιήσεσθαι. The view seems to have
more truth in a primitive, than in a civilised‚ state of society.
