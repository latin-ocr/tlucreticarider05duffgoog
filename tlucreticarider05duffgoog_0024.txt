XX INTRODUCTION

Lucretius is no cynic: with many other great qualities he has
a manly tenderness of heart; but he is never light-hearted.
This may be due to temperament, to misadventures in life,
to anxiety for the future of his country. But it can hardly be
doubted that he was thus led to exaggerate immensely the effect-
produced on men in general by the terrors of death and the
unseen world. There is little evidence, either in the literature
or the sepulchral inscriptions of the RomanS, to show that such
forebodings had power to overshadow the whole of life and
darken every pleasure 1. Yet this is what Lucretius expressly
says; and it is from this fear that he seeks to set men free.
It should be noticed that Lucretius was prevented by his
philosophie creed from using two arguments which are generally
prominent in appeals of this kind. Seneca was a Stoic², and
Plutarch a Platonist3 so that both of them can speak con-
fidently of a future life of far greater happineSS, awaiting the
souls of the wise and good³. Again, they both insist upon the
miseries of this mortal life, in the spirit of the Greek saying,
that the shortest life is the best, and better still not to have been
born at all4. But Epicurus not only denied the future existence
of the soul, but also repudiated with horror the pessimistic view
of life5. As was said above, in Lucretius himself there is a vein
of pessimism: ‘yet he nowhere says that life is in itself an evil,
and dismisses in two lines⁰ the thought which Juvenal expands

¹ See Sellar‚ Roman Poets qfthe Republic, p. 378.

² The Stoics held that the individual soul would survive until the
destruction of the world: as the world's life was calculated at 6‚57o,ooo
y'earS, Stoicism offered a· fair imitation of immortality.
