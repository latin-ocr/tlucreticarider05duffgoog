about things which our senses cannot perceive (atomS‚ for
example), we must proceed by inference from the things which
. we can perceive1. A third rule is included in Canonic: this is,
that words must not be used metaphorically but in their primary
sense& Such is the rudimentary form in which Epicurus ad-
mitted Logic as a part of philosophy.

Of the other two parts of the system, Ethics was to Epicurus
of paramount importance, and Physics was studied only for
the sake of Ethics. The former is a theory of the universe and
of man, explaining his place therein‚ his constitution, and natural
powers. This knowledge must be combined with the practical
or ethical part of the system, because men are by nature, to use

the striking figure of Lucretius⁸, like children frightened in the “

dark: as the sunlight banishes their terrorS, so a scientific
knowledge of the laws of nature sets us free from the two chief
scourges of life, sear of the godS, and sear of hell, and renders
a theory of conduct possible. The Physics of Epicurus serves
only as a basis of Ethics.

Now, it was this Physics, or Natural Science‚ which Lucretius
sets forth in his poem, De Rerum Natura: of Ethics or Canonic he
only treats incidentally, though, from the nature of the subject,
it happens that in the third book there is a good deal of ethical
discussion. His first two books deal with the Atomic Theory‚
his last two with Cosmology: in the middle he places the Epi-
curean explanation of the mind and soul of man, adding in
the fourth book an account of the way in which sight and the
other senses are supposed to operate. In this central part of
the poem, the nucleus of the whole work, he seeks to exorcise
the sear of death and, still more, the sear of everlasting punish-
ment after death.
