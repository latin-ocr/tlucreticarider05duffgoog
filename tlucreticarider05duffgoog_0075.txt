NOTES. 47

τε τῶν φόβων καὶ τῆς χαρᾶς. He concluded this from observation of the
way in which the heart beats for sear or pleasure. See Introd. p. xiii.
situm...haeret, ‘is permanently placed.’

141. exultat denotes the ‘throbbing' of the beart.

pavor, ‘ panic sear ’ς metue, ‘apprehensiom’

circum governs haec loca.

142. mulcent, ‘ soothe a man ’τ cf. v 571.

143. cetera. pars ammae, i-e. the anima: again 1. 150. The
phrase is not exact, because the animus is not strictly part os the anima
at all; but Lucr. has to face a great difficulty of terminology here,
because he has no distinct equivalent sor ψυχή which includes both the
rational and vital principles. Hence he uses anima here as==pvx⁷5.

144. Action must in all cases be initiated by the animus where the
will resideS.

numen momenque = νεῦσιν καὶ ῥοπήν, ‘the bidding and , influence. '
Other writers use momentum rather than momen with this meaning.

145. id, i.e. consilium 1. 139.

sapa, ‘ has reason ἐ the only distinct allusion in this book to the .
highest faculty of the mind; elsewhere Lucr. speaks of the passions,
sear, joy, etc., which also are peculiar to it.

gaudet: the opposite feeling also must be understood as implied by

this: cf. laeditur 1. 149.
' 146. ree, ‘the impression.'

una: adv„ ‘together with the mind?

147—151 is not a part of the argument: it is rather a concession;
the real argument begins at verum: ‘though in some cases the emotions
os the mind may be confined to itself‚ the soul is affected whenever the
emotion is violent: consequently the soul and mind are substantially the
same thing.’

151. novitate: the sense of the word is neutral here, though it
generally means a change for the worse.

153. consentire, ‘seels in unison': a translation of συμπάσχειντ cs.
Cic. De N. D. iii 28 iste quasi consensus quam συμπάθειαν Graeci vocant.
All the symptoms which follow are physical ; but, as the body cannot
feel except through the soul, they are proofs that the soul is affected by
the mind.

154„ ita, ‘in consequence.’

toto corpore: this must be due to the anima which is spread through
the whole body: if the animus alone were at work, the symptoms would
be confined to the breast.
