88 LUCRETIUS, 111.

materiai corpora is one of his many names sor ‘ atomS.’

810. ante, i.e. in his first book.

812. inane, τὸ κενόν, ‘ void‚’ is the second factor of the universe: it
is not merely the negation of body: it exists as truly as bodyt but it is
intangible substance (ἀναφὴς φύσις, intactilis natura), so that blows of
atoms cannot touch it. ’ ”

813. neque ab ictu tangitur hilum, ‘ and is not affected in the
least in consequence of a blow.'

For ab mu, cf. ab rebus 1. 8202 sor sung-itur (the passive offacit),
see n. to 1. 168.

814. nulla 1001 copia, ‘no abundance of room’: locus (τόπος) is
‘ void ' considered as the medium in which bodies are placed.

816. summarum summa. is the universe (τὸ πᾶν)ε haec rerum summa
is ‘ this world,’ lit. the aggregate of matter which we see.

817. qul=aliqui ε ullus would be more usual.

affingunt, sc. res.

818. After this 1. something is lost: see the analysis above: another
indication of this is the absence of the subject (anima) to habendast.

819. It now occurs to Lu'cr. that there is a fourth thing in the
Epicurean system which is immortal‚ i. e. the gods, Can the soul be
immortal for the same reason as the gods ἰ’ They are immortal because
of their composition: their bodies are formed by a perpetual succession
of atonis in the intermundia where they live: these atoms by their
confluence form the divine being for a moment and then stream away,
and their place is taken by others. The divine substance is thus
constantly changing and as constantly being renewed. In fact, an eternal
water-fall will give an illustration of the composition and continued
existence of these gods.

(Giussani was' the first to give this interpretation of the passage. His
view is strongly supported by a text of Stobaeus (Usener l. l. p. 239 n.)
which says that Epicurus recognised four immortal substanceS, τὰ ἄτομα,
τὸ κενὸν, τὸ ἄπειρον, τὰς ὁμοιότητας (which refers to the god& as made os
a succession of similar combinations of atoms). Lucr. takes these four
in exactly the same order.)

ideo magis, ‘for the reason that follows rather' than sor those
which precede and account for the eternity of atomS, void, and the uni-
verse.

The subject anima has to be supplied.

820. vitalibus ab rebus, ‘by the forces that maintain life‘: cf. ii
57 5 nunc hic, nunc illic superant vitalia rerum Ι et superantur item.
