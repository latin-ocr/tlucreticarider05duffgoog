sbrmer separation of soul and body snapped the chain of our con·

sciousness.) A man cannot suffit· in the sutum, unless hc exis-ts

in the future, and death cuts him qff from such existence. When

he is once dead, he is in the same position as {f ke had never bem

’ Lucr. now begins to draw the practical inferences from the pre·
ceding arguments.

830. Other philosophers had saidt ‘Death is not an evil ’ς Epicurus
said moret he said (Usener LI. p. 71) ὀ θάνατος οὐδὲν πρὸς ἡμᾶς· τὸ ’γὰρ
eadivae.- ἀναισθητεῖ, τὸ δ’ ἀναισθητοῦν οὐδὲν πρὸς ἡμᾶς. and (1.1. p. σι)
τὸ φρικωδέστατον τῶν κακῶν, ὁ θάνατος, οὐθὲν πρὸς ἡμᾶς, ἐπειδή περ ὅταν
μὲν ἡμεῖς ὦμεν, ὁ θάνατος οὔ πάρεστιν, ὅταν δ’ ὁ θάνατος παρῇ, τόθ’ ἡμεῖς
οὐκ ἔσμεν. Lucr. reproduces both these arguments in this paragraph.

831. habetur, ‘is considered’= cp. 1. 819: Lucr. assumes that his
arguments have carried conviction.

832. He takes the most stirring event in all the past history os
Rome, the Second Punic War.

aegri is partitive, aster nil.

835. homda contremuere, ‘shuddered and quaked.‘

836. ruere: the subject is omnes humani (cf. 1. 80) which appears
first in the relative clause: see n. to 1. 133.

utrorum: the Carthaginians have been mentioned; the Romans it
is unnecessary to mention. Cf. Livy xxix 17, 6 (from an ambassador’s
speech in the Senate) in discrimine est nunc humanum omne genus,
utrum vos an Carthaginienses principes terrarum videat.

839. uniter apti, ‘formed into a single being’: cf. n. 805, 845:
our identity and personality depend upon the organic union of body and
soul. Δ
842. The phrase is osten figuratively used: see n. to Juv. 6, 283.
But here Lucr. means literally that a much more srightful oetastrophe
than the Punic wan, the actual destruction of the world, would be
nothing to a dead man.

843—861 contains a digression, in which Lucr. makes two sup·

positions, the first of which he has repeatedly proved impossible
(e.g. 11. 624—633); but the second he admits to be probable‚ or even
more than probable‚

(Though the device of a bracket has been used in the text, it is
probable that these lines are not really a digression but a kind of note,
which Lucr.‚ on revision, added to his text. Ῑξ so, the note was never ’
properly incorporated with the context. For, though the connexion
