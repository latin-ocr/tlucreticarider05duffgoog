INTRODUCTION xiii

Epicurus did distinguish two parts of the souI, a rational part
localised in the breast, and an irrational part diffused throughout
the body ; these correspond to the animus and anima of Lucretius.

Epicurus found this distinction in the systems of Plato and
Aristotle, in both of which the soul consists of a higher or
rational principle and a lower or vital principle3 and this dis-
tinction he maintained, though it seems to· serve little purpose
in his system. 1t is clear that he based the distinction, like
every other point of his philosophy, upon facts of experience.
The heart beats fast in sear or joy3 therefore the animus, which
is the seat of the passionS, ,is in or near the heartl. Again, ·
a severed limb may be seen to quiver for a time upon the
ground 3 therefore the anima or life is diffused throughout the
body'- Yet the emphatic statements of Lucretius³ show that
Epicurus insisted upon some sort of identity between the two
parts·

In what then does the difference consist? We notice first
that all intellectual operations are confined to the animus: it is
the seat of the reason, of the passions, and of the will. In
sensation, on the other hand, the anima plays the important
part. Suppose 1 burn my finger,· Epicurus would explain the
process of sensation as follows· The external heat may touch
a large number of atoms of body without producing sensation,
which these cannot initiate43 but, if severe enough to be felt at
all, it touches also atoms of the am‘ma' which are present in
the finger as in every part and particle of the body. These
atoms are, as we have seen (in proposition iv), of four kinds,
The first to feel are atoms of the fourth nameless substance3
their motions produce, or rather are, the sensation, which is

αὐτὴν (i.e. τὴν ψυχὴν) συγκεῖσθαι λειοτάτων καὶ στρογγυλωτάτων, ...καὶ
τὸ μέν τι ἄλογον αὐτῆς ὃ τῷ λοιπῷ παρεσπάρθαι σώματι· ’τὸ δὲ λαγικὸν ἐν
τῷ θώρακι, ὡς δῆλον ἔκ τε τῶν φόβων καὶ τῆς χαρᾶς.

these divisions as partes of the soul-
