NOTES. 91

with what precedes is natural and satisfactory, the entire absence of any
indication at l. 862 that the former theme is now resumed, would be
impossible in a finished work. If the lines are omitted, the argument
of the whole paragraph is simple and straightforward.

Munro, following Lachmann, supposed that ll. 862—869 were con·
nected with what immediately precedes. If this were so, the words
would have to bear this meaningz ‘if any man now living is to suffer
in some future re-incarnation of his present self, his personal identity
must persist in that future life. Since death makes this impossible,
and destroys the identity of him, on whom suffering can be inflicted, we
may be sure that there is nothing for us to fear after death, and that, as
he who exists now is not identical with kim who will exist then, he
cannot suffer then.’ But it will be seen that the words in italicS, which
are essential to the argument, are not really contained in the Latin.

A further objection to this interpretation is found in l. 868, where
the Ms. reading an nullo is meaningleSS, if Lucr. is here speaking of
the supposed re-incarnation of a man now living. Lachmann accordingly
read ante ullo, Munro anne ullo.

But if Lucr. has now gone back to the original subject of the
paragraph, i.e. that what happens after our death does not concern us,
then ll. 868, 869 are quite to the point, without any change of reading.
He says in effect: ‘our little life is rounded by a sleep: it is a mere
speck in the midst of two infinitieS, during both of which we are not ⁶
living3 so that, when the brief episode os his lise is over, the dead man
is in the same position as if he had never been born.’

This explanation of the passage is adapted from Giussani’s commen-
tary. Brieger was the first to dismiss Lachmann’s interpretation.)

843. The natural order of the words is: et si iam animi natura
sentit, postquam de corpore nostro distracta est. Lucr. might have
written sentit nostr-03 but he seems to have a liking for such inversions
of the natural order. Ovid has many such: e-g. si quis in hoc artem
populo non novit amandi.

iam, ‘ for the sake of argument’: see n. to l. 540.

845. comptu coniugioque, ‘ by the binding tie of marriage
between...)

Lucr. means: ‘my soul is not me, my body is not me, my body

and soul together are me3 but (ll. 847—853) if they come together '

again, they are a different me.’
847. materiem, ‘atoms ' both of body and of soul.
850. tu quoque tactum, ‘even that result.’
