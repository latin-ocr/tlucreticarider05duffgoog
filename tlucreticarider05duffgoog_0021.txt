INTRODUCTION xvii

(xiv) If the soul passed for ever from one body to another,
the soul of a sheep might be found in a lion, but,this is contrary
to experience. The different kinds of animals have permanent
characteristics: this proves that the soul, as well as the body,
is transmitted by the parents. But, if SO, the soul was born,

and must therefore die (ll. 741—775).
(xv) It is absurd to suppose that there is a fierce com·

petition between souls for the shelter of each new-born body
(11· 776—783)·

(xvi) A law of nature requires all things to grow in their
proper environment: the soul requires the environment of the
body, and cannot be supposed to be produced or exist outside
the body (ll. 784—805).

(xvii) Four things only are immortal, atomS‚ void, the uni—
verse, and the gods 1. But the soul is not like any of these, and
is therefore mortal (11. 806—829).

With regard to these arguments, it should be noted, first,
that there is a marked division before 1. 670. The first ten
arguments are intended to prove that the soul cannot survive
the death of the body: the five which follow deny the pre-
existence of the soul. The ancient thinkers who maintained
the immortality of the soul, generally understood by this doc-
trine, not only that the soul would never die but also that it had
always existed. Lucretius seeks to disprove both parts of the
theory& There is a second division after l. 783, the two final
arguments being of a more general character.

Secondly, it cannot be denied that there is a certain amount ἱ
of confusion and repetition. Indeed one argument (x) is so
entirely out of place where it stand3‚ that I have followed
Giussani in transposing it, not thinking it possible that Lucretius
can have placed it where we find it in the MSS. But, further,
notice how argument (vi) is separated by two irrelevant para-
graphs from argument (ix), to which it is closely related. Again
(vii) has a strong resemblance to (xvi): indeed the argument
