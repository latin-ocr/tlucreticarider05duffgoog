851. manua nostrl, ‘the chain of our consciousne38‚’ i. e. the
power of retracing our past and recognising our identity at each stage.
852, 853. ‘So, in fact, we are not concerned about the personality
(nobis), which we have been before, nor do we now feel any distress
about that personality.‘ Lucr. is now showing that what he had
suggested as a hypothesis (1. 847), is a reality.
853. mis, sc. nobis, ⁸ our former selves!
854. nam refers to a suppressed thought, i.e. ‘and there must have
been such previous combinations of our atoms ε for etc.’
oum respicias, ‘ when one considers'z when the second person
has this general sense, the subj. is regularly used: cf. ll. 213, 856.
In the Epicurean view, time never had a beginning.
855. materiai, ‘of atoms.'
856. mammem quam sint, lit. ‘of how many methods are...,'

pom. sor metrical convenience. so repostus.

‘not the course
Of an the centuries yet to come,
And not the infinite resource
Os Nature, with her countless sum

of figures, with her fiilness vast
Of new creation evermore,

Can ever quite repeat the past,
Or just thy little sels restore.'

859. memori mente=mem0rim

id, ‘the sact’ of our previous existence.

860. nitor belongs to iecta.

vmu pausa, ⁸ a stoppage of life‚’ i.e. death: cf. 1. 930.

861. ‘ The motions have strayed from sensations’ means: the atomic
motions have ceased to produce sensation. Cf. l. 924 longe ab smstfinlr
primordia motibus errant: the meaning is the same here, though the
expression is peculiar: the atoms which produce sensation are still in
motion during the stoppage of life, but, as they are no longer shut up in
the body, they are not sensfferi.
