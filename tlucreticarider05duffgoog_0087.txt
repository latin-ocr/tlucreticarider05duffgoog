NOTES. 59

344. This is equivalent toz corpus atque anima mutuis contagiis
discunt vitalis motus.

348. eomunotast causa. saluus, ‘the cause of their existence
depends on their reciprocal action 'z for coniuncta, cf. contagia (1. 345):
they are equivalents for συμπάσχειν and συμπάθειαε see n. to 1. 153.

349. naturam eorum=ea, i.e. the body and the soul: see n.
to 1. ¹30·

350-— 369. T he view that sensatim is confined to the soul and not shared
by the body, is refuted by experience. ·lt is true that the body Ioses
sensatim at death; but sensation was not dun'ng life inherent in the
body. The eyes bave sensation and see .· it is not the mind that does
the seeing: experience proves this.

I think Giussani is clearly right in not marking a new paragraph at
l. 359. There is no new argument but only an illustration of what goes

350. refutat, ‘tries to disprove.'

352· nominituo is used sor nominare for metrical reasons3 and so
impen‘tare for imperare (1. 1028).

353. ‘ He is fighting against certain facts which are actually (vel)
plain to the senseS.’ Epicurus insists that all that our senses tell usis
ἐναργές (manifestum, ⁸ clearly true ’): cf. Usener l. l. p. 5 κατὰ τὰς
αἰσθήσεις δεῖ πάντα τηρεῖν. Cic. De Fin. i 22 (of Epicurus) iudicia rerum
in sensibus ponit. See Introd. p. ix. '

354. ⁶ For who will ever explain what sensation of the body is, if
that, which our experience (res) has made clear and taught us, does not
explain it?’: i.e. our senses themselves tell us that the body feeIS, and
there is no other explanation possible.

corpus sent1m=r5 αἰσθάνεσθαι τὸ σῶμα, and is used as the nom. of
a noun. The phrase must stand for ‘ the apparent sensation of the
body,’ as Lucr. cannot expect his opponents to explain what they deny .
to be the case.

adferet, sc. rationem: so Lucr. (i 566) uses reddere for reddere
rationare, ‘to explain.’

355. ι1 non: supply id adseret.

palam dedit :palam ficit, dare often having this meaning in old
Latin: so dat stragem (i 288), and turbas dare (often in Plautus).

356. at introduces an objection: viz. the fact that the body loses
sensation at death, proves that it did not enjoy sensation during life.

namquo, ⁸ altogether.’
