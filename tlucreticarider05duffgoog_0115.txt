NoTEs. 89

Epicurus taught that there was a perpetual war between the preserving
and destroying forces os nature= their power is exactly equal, so that
sor everything that is dissolved into atoms, a new thing is made, and
the‘ sum of matter in the universe remains constant.

munita. ab is unusual for the simple abl.= but Lucr. uses.this ab os
things, as well as persons, with some freedom ε cf. 1. 813.

821. aut, ‘either’= there are two ways in which the preserving
forces may work. veniuntz see n. to l. 752.

aliena. mutis: ‘causes of destruction’: according to Epicurus 'all
things are destroyed either by violent assault from without or by
disintegration from within (11. 807, 808) ; but in the latter case also
the destructive force first comes from without and then works from
within.

823. sentire queamus, ‘ before we,’ i. e. our souIS‚ ‘ can feel?

The 1. printed below the text was suggested by Lachmann to supply
the missing apodosis of the sentence.

824. praeter quam make one word.

cum is the preposition.

Τὴε soul suffers (1) bodily pain in the present, (2) fiear for the future,
(3) sorrow for the past. But the two last are most prominent here:

what seems to him the most striking difference is the presence in the
former, and the absence in the latter, of the two main causes of un-
happiness‚ anxiety for the past and anxiety for the future.

825. advenit 111 answers to veniunt of 1. 82 r.

826. male habet, “Ρ1αςιιεείῒ.’ψ
827. praetorius male admissis is abl. absol.

828. furorem ammi propi-mm, ‘ madness peculiar- to the mind‚’ is
opposed to the delirium caused by bodily sickness: cf. l. 464. The
same epithet must be supplied with oblivia rerum.

8 30—869. Since the soul is mor-tal, death is nothing to us. Just as
events which happened before we were born were nothing to us, ,
so whatever may happen after our death cannot affect us at all. (If
it were possible for our soul to feel aster leaving the body, that
would not concern us,- for our individuality consists of the union
os body and soul. Further‚ if the atoms, which form our body and
soul, should in thefuture re-unite-and this is a most probable sup- ’
position, when one considers the infinite duration of time and the
endless activity of aiones—even that would not concern us, os the
