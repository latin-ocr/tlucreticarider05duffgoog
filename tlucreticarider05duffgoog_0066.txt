38 LUCRETws, 111.

Iurando: the twittering of the swallow is contrasted with the
magnificent, if mythical, song of the swan. In view of the common use
of χελιδών and χελιδονίζειν, Lucr. may intend to convey the notion that
compared with Epicurus he is a foreign stammerer.

7. ‘tremuliffi ‘staggering’: because of their tender age.

8. et, ‘aS,’ after consimile: ac is commonet, but even Cicero some·
times uses et thus: see Madvig on Cic. De Fin. ii 21.

9. rerumz the ‘ things’ are the tenets of the philosophy: Lucr.
supplies verba, not res.

patria, ‘of a father': cf. i 94 patrio nomine, ἕ with the name of
father.’

10. inclute, ‘thou famous man' .the same epithet is applied (v 8)
to Memmius, to whom the whole poem is addressed.

chartis. Epicurus left three hundred volumina of philosophy, but
his only extant writings are three letterS, none of them long, which give
a summary account of points os his system 3 there are also many frag·
ments. The work most akin to the poem of Lucr. was his treatise περὶ
φύσεως in 37 volumina. It is known that he left two epitomes, a larger
and a smaller, of his system3 and it is generally believed that the μεγάλη
ἐπιτομή is the main authority. which Lucr. followed, though his own
language here surely suggests that he browsed at large upon all the
writings and extracted the matter of his poem from the whole field.

13. semper strengthens perpetua: cf. v 32 5 semperque aeterna fuere.

14. ratio, ‘system,’ ‘philosophy’: cf.1. 45.

vociferari, ‘to cry aloud': it is a clear, loud message to man, no

whisper in a corner.
15. ‘naturam rerum, ‘the nature of things'z this is an equivalent

for φύσις which Epicurus explained in his φυσιολογία or account of the
universe, the world, and man.

divina, ‘superhuman’ t cf. v 8 (of Epicurus) deus ille fuit.

16-2 5. According to Epicurus, the universe (τὸ πᾶν) contains
innumerable worlds (κόσμοι, mundz); between these worlds are spaces
called μετακόσμια (intermundia), in which the gods live. Our world is
bounded by the empyrean or upper air (aether); in this the stars are set,
not worlds themselves, but forming quite small appendages to our world.

By his genius Epicurus was able to transcend the power of sight and
discover what goes on outside our world3 and the same secret is revealed
to all faithful Epicureans.

16. moenia mundi, ‘the walls of the world,’ i.e. the empyrean by
which our world is bounded,
