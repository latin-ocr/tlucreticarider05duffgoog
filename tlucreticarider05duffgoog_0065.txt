NOTES.

1—30. Epicurus, wlzofirst brought light and joy into the world, is my
master and teaclzer and example. His philosophy first despelled the

sear qf the gods and thefi’ar of hell, provingthat thefirst have nothing
to do with man and that the second does not exist.

This book, like the fifth and sixth, begins with a panegyric on
Epicurus: the first has one also (ll. 62—79) aster the invocation and
dedication prefixed to the whole work.

α. primum cf. i 66 primum Graius h0m03 v 9 princeps vitae ratio-
nem invenit. Lucr. insists upon the originality of EpicuruS, because the
rival schooIS, notably the Stoics, denied it: cf. Cic. De Fin. i 17 in
physicis...totus est alienus: Democritea dicit, perpauca mutans.

commoda vitae, ‘the good things of life’z cf. commoda sumit
(iv 1074): this is a translation of the technical term συμφέροντα which
are distinguished from the ἀγαθόν οι· summum bonum (vi 26).

These had always existed but were not perceived till Epicurus threw
light upon them.

3. Graiae gentis decus: Epicurus was an Athenian citizen born at
Samos (where his father was a κληροῦχος) B.c. 342· It should be
observed how Lucr. prefers not to name his master direetly: cf. i 66·
Graius homo: the name only occurs once in the poem (iii 1042) where a
periphrasis is hardly possiblez to Lucr. the name is too sacred for
ordinary mention.

Graius is an Epic equivalent ior Graecus, regularly used by Luer.

4. ficta, an archaic form offic-sa, having a different suffix.

The language used is very emphatic and seems intended to assert
as strongly as possible his dependence upon Epicurus. In sact, there
is no reason to believe that Lucr. made any alterations in the system
which he found in Epicurus.

5. cenandi cupidus=quod certare cupio.

6. imitari seems to mean, ‘to reproduce,’ almost ‘to translate. ’
