NOTES. 87

⁸ absurd. (To Lucr. ‘ invulnerable ' and ‘immortal’ are synonymous

terms.)

There is no connexion between this argument, so understood, and
that which begins at l. 819. Lucr. here objects that the union of a
vulnerable and an invulnerable is absurd 3 it is no answer to say, what
is there said, that the invulnerable may remain invulnerable.

803. monita-ns, ‘incongruous’z cf. the use of ᾱίεενεραίεμάχεται
i 582.

806—829. Anytking that is eterna! must satisfit one of three conde‘tions.
Either it must be impenetrable to blows, as atoms are ‚· or it must be
untouclted by them, as void is; or there must be no room outside of it
into which it can pass, as is the case with the universe as a whole.
[But the soul does not satisfit any os these conditions and must there·

sore ῥιπὶ-[ι] There is yet another way in which the soul might be
immortal: it might be protected from harm by its constitution, as the
gods are. But this is not so: for tlte soul stgffers remorse sor the past
and anxiety sor the fitture ,· it is affected by diseases qf the body and
is exposed ako to diseases qs its own.

The first 13 lines of the paragraph are repeated exactly v 351—363.
Till recently, editors have rejected them here as a marginal quotation
added by some early reader. But Giussani's arguments sot retaining them
are, in my opinion, conclusive. (ι) They do not, as Lachmann supposed,
interrupt an argument: see nn. to ll. 802, 819. (2) The repetition
in the fifth book is not in itself suspicions3 we have just had 14 11. (784-
796) which are repeated in the fisth book. (3) As the end of his long
series of arguments, it is eminently natural that Lucr. should draw a
final argument from the first principles of his philosophy: if the argu·
ment is‘ naturally-used in the fifth book to prove the mortality os this
world, it is still more in place here: indeed it is difficult to believe that
Lucr. could have omitted it. The argument, as it standS, is imperfect:
some. supplement such as is given in brackets above is necessary. But
it is quite possible that some n. have been lost after 1. 818: it is
generally agreed that something is lost aster 1. 823.

807. solido: this is a technical term in Lucr., meaning ‘without
void.’ That atoms contain no void, was proved i 503 foll.

respuere, ‘ defy‚’ ⁸ laugh at.’

808. elul, ‘into themselves': dat. of local relation.

809. inm pmcn :partes quae sunt intusa atoms have parts, but
are indivisible.
