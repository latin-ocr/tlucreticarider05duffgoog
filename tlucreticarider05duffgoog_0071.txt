NOTES. 43

83· huno,...huno=rc)r μέν,...τὸν δέε hic, ille is commonet in this
sense, but cs. Virg. Aen. x 9 quis metus aut hos Ι aut hos arma sequi
ferrumque lacessere suasit? The personal acc. after suadere is rare3 but
ef. Virgil quoted above and Lucr. i 140 tua me virtus...snfferre laborem Ι
suadet.

pudorem, ‘honour.'

84. ln summa. suggests a climax ε ‘worst of all.’

pietas includes duty to parents and duty to country, as the next 1.
shows,

87—93. Lucr. has a great love for this simile: it occurs ii 55
and vi 353 part of it is found i 146, where nothing is said os the fears of

children in the dark‚ so that the mention of the sun is really irrelevant.
In each book the simile marks the end of the presace and is followed by

a resumption os the argument.

91. animi is governed by tenebras as well as by terrorem: radii
refers esp. to the former, tela to the latter.

93. speeies denotes the outward aspect os nature, rano its hidden
laws: the whole phrase is an equivalent of φυσιολογία.

94—135. First, the animus is an actual part of a man with a definite
place in the body. 77ae belief that the animus has no substantial
existence bu‘t is merely a harmonious relation between the parts
of the body, is erroneous: for (1) the feeling of tlte animus, whether
pleasant or painful‚ is often the reverse of the body’sfeeling; (2) while
the body sleeps‚ tlze animus is awake either to pleasure or to pain.
Secondly‚ the anima also is a part of the body, not a relation between
the parts: for life may survive much mutilation of the body, and
thus depends, not on tlte body as a whole but on a few particles
of heat and air, which therefore form the anima. Consequently the
notion of the soul being a ‘harmony' falls to the ground.

94. Lucr. deals first with the animus, the λογικόν or rational part of
the seul, and then (11. 117—129) with the anima, or irrational part: see
Introd. p. xii soll. It is somewhat remarkable that he does not state
this two-sold division of the soul until the next paragraph.

quam agrees with mentem by attraction: cf. l. roo: but this attracss
tion does not always take place: e.g. 1. 139 consilium quod nos animum
recentemque vocamus. The rule, as stated by Madvig (Gramm. ἓ 316),
is, that attraction takes place when the relative clause adds a detail of
a person or thing already defined, but does not take place when the
