80 'LUCRETIUQ 111.

totum is practically an adv. ‘wholly’: no adv. is formed from totus.
(This explanation of the last three lines is Heinze'S.)

687. ‘For the soul is so interlaced with the body....'

688. Which shows that there is anima even in the teeth.

689. morbus, ‘toothache.’

stmgor, ‘the twinge.’

690. “And the crunching of a rough pebble whenever it comes

under the teeth out of bread.'
&uses in Lucr. generally=‘corn,' from which the transition to

‘bread’ is easy.

subitis of MSS. seems impossible :'the pebble‚ or the contact with

the teeth, might be called sudden, but hardly the bread.
..691. etiam atque etiarn: see n. tol. 228.

692. nec leti lege solutas: this is not partos the original argument
but is added for symmetry and is then explained in ll. 695—697.

694. insinuatas = si essent insinuatae.

700. tanto qu1que magis: ‘all the more’: it is a stronger form of
tanto magis, as utqui and atqui are of ut and at t with qui and quiqtm cf.
ὃς and ὅς re: quique is the old abl. of an indefinite pronoun, used as an
enclitic for emphasis: lit. ‘in some way‚’ like πώςι cf. v 343, vi 460
quam quoque magis=quam magis: it cannot be translated. This use of
qui is common enough (see n. to l. 7 38); but such a use of quique seems
peculiar to Lucr.

<mm corpore fusa peribit, ‘the process of fusing with the body will

te kill it.’ cum corpore is not to be taken with peribit, ‘as there is no
= reference here to the death of the body but rather to its birth.

702—704. Food, in blending with the body, ceases to be food and
becomes flesh and blood. . The illustration is not very apt, as Lucr.
himself has to admit that the particles of soul would not, by fusion with
the body, become something different but only a new soul. To take
another instance, water might ooze through porous stone, and yet, on
Epicurean principle& lose none of its essential characteristics in the
process.

702. dispertitus has emphasis and therefore comes first. caulas:
cavulas, ‘poros’

704. naturam, ‘substance,’ i.e. flesh and blood.

705. quamvis integra, ‘however entire they are when they....'

recena, ‘new-made,' the theory supposing that the soul is transfused
through the body at birth.

708. haec &ulmi natura, ‘our present soul.'
