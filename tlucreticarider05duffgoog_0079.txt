NOTES. 5 1

198. The only verse in Lucr. ,that ends in 4 spondees. virgil has
one such in the Georgics (iii 276), and two in the Aeneid (iii 743
vii 634).

199. noenu: again iv 712: it is ne unum and is an archaic form
of non. it is found only in Lucr., but noenum occurs in Plautus and
other early writers.

The emphatic noenu potest, following potest 1.196, seems to prove
that both verbs have the same subject3 and, if 50, the conjectures of
Munro and others for spicarumque are out of place.

parvissima: Lucr. osten uses this form of the superlative; he
seems to reserve minimum for the technical notion of ‘least possible.'

What he says here is true of all very small bodies with the im-
portant exception of atomS.

2ο2. aspera: this refers to the spicae which are entangled and
held together by their rough beards: Iapides are not necessarily rough.

The ending of the l. is an echo to the sense.

206. ο bone, ‘ my good friend'= a personal appeal to Memmius. ’,’

207. cluebit means no more than en't.

208. eius ε this would naturally refer to the animus which was the
subject of the last argument; but l. 216 shows that the anima is now
under consideration: the fact is, Lucr. feels that they are, in respect
of composition, identical: so they both appear in ll. 212 and 228.

210. conglomerati: this is only a supposition, the fact being that
the anima is diffused throughout the whole body.

212. indepta: the verb is formed by prefixing indu to apzltcor:
cf. indugredi, indupedire, induperator.

213. nil libatum cernae, ‘one can see no diminution' ι the subj.
-is potentiale see n. to L 854.

214. omnia. praestat, ‘ makes good everything,' i.e. takes away
nothing.

217. nexam—nervos: this implies that, just because the soul-
atoms are so small, some of them are found in every part. of the
body.

218. quatenus, ‘ since ἐ so always in Lucr.

219. circumcaesura, ‘ contour.'

221. quod genus est, ‘just ’z πνεῖται.

Bacchi flos, {the bouquet of wine.’ -

223. meus, ‘taste' ; not ‘juice'; for a dried fruit is lighter than
a fresh one.

226. , nimirum quia, ‘surely because... 'z nimirum is very often
