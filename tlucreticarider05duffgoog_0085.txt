NoTEs 57

3¹ 1. proclivius, ‘ more readily’: Lucr. has in his mind the original
meaning of the word, ‘ down-hill,' as the verb decurrat shows.

313. clementius aeque, ‘ more meekly than is right ': this man is
wanting in proper pride.

315. sequacis, ‘clinging'z it is proverbially difficult sor a man to
change his character= cf. curae sequaces (ii 48).

316. casm, ‘ invisible.' The differences of character all depend
upon the different shapes of atoms which form the soul.

317. quot: supply figurae, not nomina.

319. sslud=r66e3 ‘one thing.'

firmare, „⁸ to assert ἰ confirmare is commoner in this sense.

3²0· naturarum=of natural defects.

321. rano, ⁴ philosophy ’ t of course the Epicurean philosophy
alone is credited with this power.

322. So Epicurus ends his letter to Menoeceus (Usener l. l. p. 66)
with the promise that by studying this philosophy he shall be free from
disquietude by night and by day, and shall live as a god among men.

323—349. Soul and body are in intimate anion with each other: on
the one hand, the body keeps the soul together ; on tlte other hand,
the soul imparts lzfe to the body. The relation between the two is so
close that tlze soul cannot be withdrawn from the body without the
destruction of both. Seu-ration is produced by their union. The
body cannot exist apart fi‘om the soul. Their close union is proved
by the fact that they cannot exist separately.

,This argument would be clearer if Lucr. had not omitted to prove
one half of it, i.e. that the existence of the soul depends upon the body:
he only proves that the existence of the body depends upon the soul.
But there is a reason for the omission: for the second part of the book

¹ (11. 417—829) consists entirely of arguments to show that the soul cannot
exist without the body.

323. haec natura=this thing, i.e. the soul, comprising the animus
and the anima.

tenetur, ‘is sheltered‚’ represents στεγάζεται which Epicurus uses in
the same connexion: see n. to l. 569.

324. ipsa, ‘in turn.’

salutis, ‘ existence ἐ so salvus often=vivus.

326. normale, ‘destruction to both.'

non posse videntur, ‘they clearly cannot be': cf. ll. 333, 338, and
see n. tol. 164.
