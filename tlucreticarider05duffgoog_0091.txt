No‘rES. 65

42ο. eura: some edd. keep vita of the MSS. and say that vita:
moribus, or that the words mean ⁴ worthy to be your rule of life.’
1 cannot think either interpretation possible.

422. verbi causa, ‘ sor example,' refers to animam: animum would
have done as well, he means. ⁶

dicero pergam, ‘ 1 shall in future speak of....'

423. dicere: the subject meis understood.

424. He reasserts here the gist of ll. 136—160, the close connexion
and actual identity of the animus and anima: ‘they are a single thing
and one united substance.’

quatenus: see n. tol. 218.

est: the verb is attracted into the sing. by the predicate unum.

426. docui, ‘I have proved': cf. ll. 179 foll.

animam must be supplied as subject of constare.

corporibus and principue (42 7) are both ‘ atoms.’

428. iam, ‘it follows at once that: is Lachmann’s emendation of
nam. If nam is kept, there is a long parenthesis srom it to the end os
l. 433, after which the argument is resumed with nunc igitur quoniam. -

At first sight nam appears to be right: for Lucr. before (11. 179 foll.)
proved the tenuitas of the soul-atoms by their mobilitas3 and nam
makes him do so here also. Yet in his atomio theory these two qualities
are so related that it seems possible he could prove each by means of
the other. And the reasoning of this passage seems to require iam.
The point on which Lucr. is here insisting‚ is not the tenuitas, but
the mobilitas, of the atom3‚ because this implies a want of cohesion
which causes them to be easily scattered. If nam be read, the cardinal
point of the mobilitas is put in parenthetically and only as a proof of
the tenuitas. Another objection to the parenthesis is that after nunc
rjgv‘tur quoniam, the original statement, i.e. the tenuitas, should be
repeated ; but it is not.

429. magu goes with ten'ui.

430. magmbue: Lucr. uses this word (and simulacra) to represent
the εἴδωλα by which Epicurus accounted for sensation and thought. These
are exceedingly fine films which are constantly being discharged from
the surface of all bodieS, bearing the exact likeness of the body itself.
When we are awake‚ a succession of these images strikes the atoms of
anima in our eyes and causes sensation there, so that we see the thing;
but when we are asleep, they penetrate to the animus and the sensation
takes place in it, so that we dream of seeing the object.

Smoke and mist are chosen because of their tenuitas ; the imago of
