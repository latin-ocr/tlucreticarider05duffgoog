xvi INTRODUCTION

that the rational soul (animus) can be cure‘d of mental disease,
is itself a proof of mortality (ll. 459—52 5).

(iv) As the organs of sensation cannot exist apart from the
body, the rational soul (animus), which is practically an organ
of sensation, cannot do so either (ll. 548—5 57).

(v) As the functions of the soul depend entirely upon its
union with the body, they must cease when this union is dis-
solved (11. 558—594). ’

(νὶ) As the departure of the soul is followed by the utter
collapse of the body, we must suppose that the soul was rent
in pieces even before it left the body (11. 595—614).

(vii) It is a law of nature that every organism must exist in
its own environment: therefore the rational soul (animus) can
exist nowhere except in the body and in a fixed part of it
(ll. 615—623).

(viii) If the soul is to exist and have sensation apart from
the body, it must have the organs of sensation also; but eyes
and ears cannot exist apart from a body (ll. 624—633).

(ix) 1f a living body is suddenly cut in tw0, the soul also is
divided3 but that which is cut into parts, cannot be immortal
(n. 634—669).

(x) In a case of natural death we often see the same thing,
that the bodily parts die one by one, as the soul within them
dies. Thus the soul is divided and cannot be immortal (ll. 526-
547¹>·

(xi) The soul cannot have existed before the body, or it
would remember its past existence (11. 670—678).

(xii) The close connexion between soul and body, which
we see in sensation, would never be established if the body were
formed first and the soul then introduced. Therefore the soul
did not exist before the body (ll. 679—712).

(xiii) The living creatures that swarm in a decaying body,
prove that particles of the soul remain behind after death. But

if the soul that went forth, went forth diminished, it cannot be
immortal (ll. 713—740).
