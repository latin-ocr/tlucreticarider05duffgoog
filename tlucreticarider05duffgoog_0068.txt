40 LUCRETIUS, 111.

avarice, ambitiosa, and crime. Some men it has led to commit
suu-ide, others to betray their country ,· there is but one remedy sor
it, and that is tlte philosophy qs Epicurus.

Lucr. now states the subject of the book; but instead of beginning it
at once, he goes into an ethica-l digression to prove the importance of it.

31. ot quoniam docui: for this method os connecting the subject of
the book with the preface, cf. i 9513 iv 263 vi 43. ⁰

cunctarum exordia rerum :primordia rerum, the invisible atoms
out of which all things are made. He explained the qualities of atoms
in book i, their shapes and motions in book ii.

33. sponte sua is opposed to ‘by divine power ἐ for the atoms
have no power of spontaneous motion: they are driven downwards by
their own weight‚ and this downward motion is changed, first by a
swerve in their line of falling and then by the blows of other atoms.

autumo...motu: Epicurus taught that all atomS, whether free or in
combination with others, move for ever at the same immense speed: the
atoms which form a block of marble are moving just as fast as the atoms
that form air or light. Modern physical science also teaches that the
atoms of solid bodies are in constant motion.

34. quove: ve has the sense of que, as the composition of visible
things is not an alternative but an additional topic: cf. i 573 v 71.
Apparently Lucr. wishes to escape an ambiguity, as quoque might be
a case of quisque.

‘rbis sense of -ve is common in early Latin: in Plautus it has never,
except in sive, a disjunctive sense: cf. Asinar. 636 videtin vag-inti minae
quid pollent quidve possunt ἓ

35. res, ‘topics.’

For the distinction between aninam, ‘the mind,’ and anima, ‘the
soul,' cf. 11. 136-144, and see Introd. p. xii foll.

36. iam, ⁸ next)

37. There seems to be an allusion to this passage in Virg. Georg.
ii 490 felix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas Ι atque metus onmis et
inexorabile fatum Ι subiecit pedibus strepitumque Acherontis avari. Lucr.
was the happy man.

38. funditus is to be taken with ab imo. The metaphor is from a
troubled spring.

40. For the Epicurean, pleasure is the chief good 3 but all pleasures
are poisoned by the sear of death; therefore a knowledge of nature is
necessary to expel this sear: cf. Epicurus (Usener Epicurea p. 74) οὐκ ἦν
