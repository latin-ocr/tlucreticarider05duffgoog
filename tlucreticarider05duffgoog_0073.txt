i 7, -7 ‘ Pour’d out in loosnesse on the grassy grownd ’ς so Carlyle said
of a tramp lying on the grass in a London Park: ‘ he looks as if you
had poured him out of a jug.'

onustum, ‘ wearied. ’

114. The ‘ something else' is the animus, which, while the senses
are asleep, continues its independent life in our dreams.

116. motula, ‘emotions.’

cordis: as we learn in the next paragraph (1. 140), the heart is the
seat of the animus, joy and fear being felt there.

1 17. quoque, i.e. as well as the animus.

118. ense is shown to be emphatic by its position: ‘that the soul
actually exists in the frame.’

corpus also is emphatic: so far he has been speaking of sensations of
the mind.

sentire: vivere would be more exact, but life and sensation are
inseparable.

119. principio: as -only one argument folloWS, this seems to mean,
not ‘first,' but, ‘above all.’ But it is possible that prinpipt‘o has its
ordinary meaning, and that Lucr. treats the other half of his argument
(atquc eadem rursum etc.) as a second proos.

corpore multo, ‘ much of the body ἐ i.e. we may lose a limb or two
and yet not die.

121. eadem, ‘yet it,' i.e. the anima.

corpora, ‘ atoms ἐ again l. 125: one of the many names which
Lucr. uses for them. At death, breathing ceases and warmth leaves the
body: it is therefore inserted that the soul is warmth and air. So
Epicurus defines ψυχή as σῶμα. προσεμφερέστατον πνεύματι θερμοῦ τινα
κρᾶσιν ἔχοντι. Α more precise account is given ll. 177 foll.

122. aer, ‘ some air? aer here is identical with ventus (1. 126), but
later on (ll. 232, 233) is distinguished from ventus or aura.

124. non omnia corpora, ⁴ not every kind os atom '3 semina below
has the same sense as corpora.

If the soul were a mere harmonia, all the parts of the body, and all
the kinds of atoms it containS, would contribute equally to support lise
(fulcire salutem).

128. He now tacitly assumes that these atoms os wind and warmth
are the soul. est is emphatic.

130. amm natura=animusz Lucr. is extraordinarily fond of this
form of periphrasis with the gen. of nounsz when we compare his
phrase omnis nalum, ‘the universe ’ (i 419) with Plut. adv. Col. 1112 F
