72 LUCRETIUS‚ 111.

and give life to, whatever surrounds it, then the air, into which the dis-
embotlied soul passes, will get life from the soul and be a body to it3
which is absurd.

animm=animah the latter word is used only once (v 82 3) by
Lucr.

574. οο, i.e. aere.

concludere, ‘inclose’: a translation of περιέχεινε see n. to l. 569.

592—606 are inserted here by Munro. As placed in the Mss, they
certainly interrupt the argument3 but editors are not agreed as to their
right place: Christ placed them after 579, Giussani aster 612.

Munro’s arrangement seems to me the most suitable. There is this
objection to it, that the parag-raph then ends with a double conclusion,
each of four lines and each to the same effect (603—606 and 576—5 79).
This is not like Lucr. ‘

593. ⁰ videtur, ‘is seen’: see n. to 1. 164.

594. ire, ‘to depart.'

595. quasi supremo tempore, tas if the last hour were come.'

596. trunco, abl. of place.

mero, ‘to lose strength': ef. l. 452 ceciderunt artus.

597. quod genus est, ‘so it is'3 lit. ‘of this kind it is.’ Wehave
here two phrases for ‘ sainting 'z for animo male fit, cf. Plaut. Mil. Glor.
1331 animo male Ι factumst huic repente3 Curcul. 312 animo male est3
Rudens 510 animo male fit3 Ter. Ad. 655 animo male est: for the other,
which seems to be preferred by later writerS, cf. Suet. Iul. 45 repente
animo linqui solebat 3 Sen. Epp. 57, 5 quidam...succiclunt ac linquuntur·
animo; ibid. 77, 9 nobes quos aliquando layuit animus 3 id. Nat. Qu.
iv 13, 7 animo relictos aqua frig-ida spargimus.

The cxx. show that liquisse has an object, aliquem, understood.

598. trepidatur, ‘ all is confusion) This allusion to the anxiety of
the bystanders gives vividness to the description and adds a human
interest to the bare facts, Cf. 11. 467—-469,

599. reprehendero, ‘to keep from parting.’
601. haec: nom. plur. sema the only form in Lucr. as in Plautus. ·
576. etiam atque etiam: see n. to l. 228.

577. tegmine represents τὰ στεγάζοντα of Epicurus quoted above.

vitalibus auris is a periphrasis for anima, as sensus animi below is
a periphrasis for animus.

579. Cf. ll. 559, and 348 (os the body and soul) coniunctast causa

salutis: eausa. here also means ‘cause of existence’: the life of both
body and soul (duobus) depends upon their union.
