11. DIVISIONS OF THE THIRD BOOK.

The third book beginS, like the other bookS‚ with some
prefatory matter. First comes an address to Epicurus (ll. 1—30),
and then a statement of the subject, which is followed by an
ethical digression (ll. 31-93) before the subject itself is begun„

The rest of the book falls into three main divisions: first,
an account of the nature and composition of the soul (11. 94—
416); secondly a long series of arguments' to prove that the
soul is mortal (11. 417—829); and thirdly, a kind of sermon in
which Lucretius argues that man's fear of death is unreasonable

(ll. 830- 1094).

Nature and Composition os the Saul.

This is perhaps the most difficult part of the book. Let us
begin by stating in order the chief propositions which Lucretius
lays down and endeavours to prove.

(i) The soul is an actual part of a man, and not a mere
relation between the parts of his body (ll. 94-135).

(ii) The soul has two partS, the animus and the anima,
the mind and s0u11: the former is superior and is localised in
the breast, the latter diffused through the whole body. But the
two combine to form a single substance (ll. 136—160).

(iii) The soul is material, i.e. formed of atom5‚ which are
very small, smooth, and round (ll. 161-— 230).

(iv) The soul is a compound substance: there are in it
atoms of wind, atoms of heat, atoms of air, and atoms of a fourth
nameless substance in which all-sensation begins (ll. 2 31-2 57).

(v) These four substances are inextricably mixed up to-
gether so as to form a single substance. Yet one of them may

¹ There is here a difficulty of terminology. In Greek ψυχή is divided
into τὸ λόγον ἔχον and τὸ ἄλογονε but Lucretius has to divide anima
(the whole soul) into animus and anima. To avoid confusion 1 have
often retained the Latin ,names to denote the.divisions οἱ the soul-
