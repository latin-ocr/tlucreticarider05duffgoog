58 LUCRETIUS, 111.

328. haud faeile est: ‘ it is impossible.’

natura eiua, i.e. the frankincense itself. The illustration would be
more exact, if Lucr. had said that both the scent and the stuff itself would
be destroyed: the soul is to the body as the scent is to the bit of frank-
incense.

3 3ο. omnia, i.e. both soul and body.

33¹· inplexis goes with inter sc, ‘interlaced’ ΤΙιε relation between
soul and body is like that between the different elements of the soul.

prinmpfls, ⁴ atoms ἰ cf. 1. 262: primordiis, like primordiorum, is
excluded by the metre.

3 3 2. consorti—vita, ‘possessing lise as joint partners': the metaphor
is commercial : life is a sors or patrimony which they hold jointly.

333. quaeque is used, where we should expect altera, because of its
affinity for sibi.

335. The way in which sensation begins with the quarta natura of
the soul, and is transmitted step by step to the body, was described
11. 246—251: it is by the combined atomio motions of soul and body
that sensation is ‘kindled and blown into flame throughout our flesh.’
See Introd. p. xiii.

Lucr. here speaks as if sensation were produced by the mere juxta-
position of body and soul, just as water is produced by the juxtaposition
of oxygen and hydrogen. But this is not so: sensation is inherent in
the soul, and is communicated by the soul to the body (cf. 1. 3 57).

337. Now comes an argument from experience to prove the fact
stated in 1. 3²4» i-e. that the body cannot exist apart from the soul,
in fact that the soul is causa salutis of the body. It begins with
praeterea which implies that the fact stated in 1. 32 3 has already been
proved: but, as a matter oi fact, no argument has preceded it‚·but only
a statement that body and soul are indispensable to each other, then
an illustration of that statement, and then a repetition of it.

339. enim: there is a similar elision of quidem 1. 9ο4; but elision
of either an iambic or a cretic (-ν-) before a short vowel is rare in
dactylic verse.

ut, ‘in the way that...)

340. qul datus ost: i.e. the heat is not inherent in the water but
comes from without, and has been added to the water to make it boil.

convellitur, ⁸ is torn in pieces.’

343. penitus qualifies convulsi.

conque putrescunt: the tmesis is a device to introduce an unmetrical
word: cf. inque pediri (1. 484).
