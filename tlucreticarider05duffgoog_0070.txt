42 LUCRETIUS‚ 111.

61. socios scelerum cet.= Lucr. is here thinking of the Mamurras
and Vatiniuses of the time, of whom he may have heard much from
Memmius ς in the similar passage in book ii (ll. 11 soll.) he has Pompey
and Caesar moi-e directly in view.

63. vulnera vitae, ‘sores of life.’

64. non minimam panem: the qualification seems to show that
Lucr. was not quite convinced of the argument himself. As to the constr„
the ac'c. isused as an adverb: cf. vi 12 59 nec minimam partem ex agris
is maeror in urbem Ι confluxit. pan‘im is only another form of the acc.

65. ferme, ‘as a rule‚’ i-e. to most men.

66. semota, neut. plur„ agrees with the masc. and fem. subjects
which precede it.

stabili: this word is the key of the whole passage: cf. Epicurus
quoted above and Cic. De Fin. i 35 (an Epicurean is speaking) laudem
et caritatem, quae sunt vitae sine metu degendae praesidia firmissima.-

67. cunctarier is govemed by videntur: obscurity and poverty
seem, as we might say, next door to death. So Virgil (Aen. vi 273)
makes turpis Egestas live at the threshold of Orcus.

68. undeza contemptu etegestate. dum, ‘because’

se is subject of effugtkse: ea must be supplied as object of remos-se.

69. effugisse...remosse= the tense is perhaps an old Latin idioni, by
which velle is followed, esp. in laws, by the perf. inf.; cf. Hor. Sat. ii 3,
187 ne quis humasse velit Aiacem, Atrida, vetas cur ‚9 More probably it
is an imitation of the Greek aor. inf.‚ which later Latin poets use with
the exact sense of the pres. inf.; but there is no other instance in Lucr. ,
and only one in Plautus (Aul. 828 non potes probasse nugas).

70. , rem conflant, ‘they amass wealth.'

ᾖ 73. mensas odere: i. e. they fear poison: cf. Mart. xii 91, 4 times
lagonam. '

74. ab, ‘in consequence of.’

78. intereunt, ‘ wear themselves out,' not ‘ perish ἐ by ambition they
seek security but get something quite different. Here again Luer. follows
Epicurus who condemns στέφανοι καὶ ἀνδριάντων ἀναθέσεις as pleasures
which are neither natural nor necessary (Usener l. l. p.‘78 Schol.).

pmm=nmnulli and serves as subject to the verb.

ergo, when used in this sense as an archaic synonym of causa, always
follows the noun.

80. humanos=homine52 again 1. 837: a rare use.

82. With a stop at the end of this l., the MSS. reading is fairly
satisfactory: so Heinze.
