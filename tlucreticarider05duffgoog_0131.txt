NOTES. 105

he committed suicide, as here stated, is uncertain: there are* several
different traditions of the manner of his death. But Lucr. is likely to
have known what there was to be known about a man he admired so
much. He certainly speaks with approval os this suicide 3 and there is
some ground for believing that he imitated the example.

1042. Epicurus: see n. to l. 3. The name occurs again in the
Mss. ii 423 but the text is certainly corrupt there.

obit: perfect. ’

decurso lumine vitae, ‘when his light of life had run its course’:
a mixture of two metaphorS‚ decurso vitae spatio and extincto vitae
lumine.

1051. ebrius, ‘stupefied,' is metaphorical. Such a lise is not
merely useless but also unsettled and wretched.

1055. According to Lucr., the cause of this restlessness and misery

is the sear of death: men would cease to feel it, if from philosophy they
learnt the true destiny of the soul.

1056. mall moles, ‘weight of woe.'
1060. foras, i-e. into the streets: 110 does not in this case leave the

ymaguin aedibus: he is a rich man and lives in a fine house, with
a country-house too and horses and carriages: yet he is not content.
The passage is imitated by M. Amold in Obermann Once More:

‘In his cool hall, with haggard eyes,
The Roman noble lay;

He drove abroad in furious guise,
Along the Appian way.

He made a feast, drank fierce and fast,
And crown’d his hair with flowers—
No easier nor no quicker pass’d

The impracticable hours.’
