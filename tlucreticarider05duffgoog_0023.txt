INTRODUCTION xix

Livia, the con-sort of AugustuS, lost hei· son Drusus, she sought

and found comfort in the reasonings of AreiuS, a philosopher who ·

lived in the palace in the closest intimacy with Augustus 1. Nor
was it the bereaved only who had recourse to philosophers in
their trouble. When Julius Kanus was condemned to death
by Caligula, he was accompanied to the place of execution by
‘his philosopher‚’ who questioned him as to the state of his
mind2. Thus the philosopher played a part which in modern
times has generally been filled by ministers of religion: it was
his business to comfort the bereaved, to console the sorrowful‚
and to encourage the dying.

Of these three tasks Lucretius here undertakes the last: all
men must die, and his purpose is to rob death of its sting and
to enable his fellow-men to face the inevitable end without sear
For this purpose scientific demonstration is not enough. He
has already heaped proof upon proof to show that the soul does
not survive death3 but he has now to appeal to the heart as
well asto the intellect. For some men, who profess to accept
the scientific proof‚ do not really believe it³; and otherS, who
do believe it, still repine at the ‘ stern doom of every mortal lot.'
These are the two classes of men whom Lucretius has especially
in mind.

It is a remarkable fact that this missionary of an optimistic
creed has a considerable element of pessimism in himself.
Epicurus took a cheerful view of life; but the tone of his disciple
is not cheerful: where it is not sad, it is at least solemn.

¹ Seneca ad Marciam iv: non dubito quin Iuliae Augustae, quam
familiariter coluisti, magis tibi placeat exemplum ....... illa in primo
fervore, cum maxime inpatientes ferocesque sunt miseriae, consolatori se
Areio, philosopho viri sui, praebuit, et multum eam rem profuisse sibi
professa est.

·² Seneca Dial. ix 14, 9: prosequebatur illum philosophus suus, nec iam
procul erat tumulus, in quo Caesari deo nostro fiebat cotidianum sacrum
(i.e. the daily execution of his subjects). is ‘quid ' inquit, ‘ Kane, nunc
cogitas ἓ aut quae tibi mens est ? ’
