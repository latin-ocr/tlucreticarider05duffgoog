94 Lucanum, 111.

For sonere, cf. l. 156.

874. caecum stimulum, ‘hidden sting.’

876. non dat cet., ‘he does not really grant what he professes to
grant, or the fact on which he professes to grant it 'z i-e. he says he
believes he will have no sensation after death on the ground that the
soul dies with the body3 but he has not really a perfect conviction
of either fact.

unde=id ex quo, with promittit understood again.

877. 010st is a dissyllable: cf. Virg. Ecl. 3, 96 a flumine reice
capellas.

878. facit cet„ ⁴ he supposes that something of himself survivoe ’z
esse and super· form one word.

879. enim cet-2 the train of thought is as follows: ‘sor, (though
most men acquiesce in the thought of familiar modes of burial), when
anyone suggests to himself that his body will be mangled, the thought
of this abnormal treatment stimulates his imagination, and he fancies
himself present at the scene, which is a mere delusion.’ .

881. miseret is generally impersonal, misereri being used with
a personal subject.

ulm=ab illo, sc. corpore.

882. mum se angit, ‘conjures up that other self’: cs. alium se
below. The sels has really been destroyed by death, but the man
invents a surviving sels which grieves for the dead body.

883. contaminat, ‘impregnates’: the word is neutral here and
does not imply that sensus is either a good thing or a bad thing.

Cf. Hazlitt’s Table·Talk‚ p. 446 (ed. of 1901) ‘in reflecting on
death generally, we mix up the idea of life with it, and thus make it
the ghastly monster it is. We think how we should feel, not how the
dead feel.'

885. vera morto is opposed to the death which he, while still
living, imagines for himself (l. 879).

886. ‘who can remain alive and lament to sels that he himself has
met death.’

Though there is no self left, imagination goes so far as to
picture two surviving selves, of which one is tom by beasts while the

other stands by and feels pity. ⁸

888. nam cet.: the argument seems to be this: ‘I speak of buming
(un) as well as mangling (lacerari) z sor, though men dread the latter
worse, the ordinary forms os burial would be as distressing to anyone

who could feel them.·‘
