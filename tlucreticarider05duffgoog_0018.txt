xiv ' INTRODUCTION

then transmitted, in this order, to the atoms of heat, wind, and
air, and finally to the atoms of the bodyl. Unless the burn is
exceptionally severe, the sensation is confined to the finger ; but
the animus in its central position, because of its close connexion
with the amma, is aware of the burn.

It has been stated above that there are atoms of the fourth
Jnameless substance m the amma. This view has not been held
{generally22 Munro, for instance (Notes 11 p. 194), supposes
'sensation to begin with the animm, and apparently denies the

presence of the fourth substance in the anima at all. Others'

supposing the anima to be composed of the other three. But·
neither of these views can be made good, unless we suppose
that· Lucretius was grossly ignorant on a point of primary
importance3. For he expressly states: (1) that the animus
and anima form a single thing (natura)⁴; (2) that no local
separation of the four elements of soul is possible⁶; (3) that
every sensation begins with the fourth nameless element ⁶3 (and
this must be taken inconnexion with the dogma of Epicurus
stated above, that sensation takes place in the part affected, and
not in the animust). ·

We must assume, then, that the animus and anima are
identical in substance, and differ only in function. This differ-
ence may be illustrated by comparing the whole soul to a swarm
of beeS. The swarm consists of a nucleus where the bees are
closely packed together, and of outlying parts where the congre-
gation is not so dense; yet all parts consist of bees and nothing
but bees. So the animus is the nucleus of the soul-a’tomS,

² Both Giussani and Heinze state it independently. I doubt il
anyone will gainsay it in future.

⁸ Itis out of the question to suppose that Lucr. purposely diverged
from the teaching of EpicuruS.
