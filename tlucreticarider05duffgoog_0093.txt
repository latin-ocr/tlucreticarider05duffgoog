449. inde, ‘later-⁹

actae, ‘their life)

450. auctior: cf. dominantior 1. 3972 the participle is compared
like an adj. ·

454. omma, ‘ all the faculties ἰ cs. As You Like It 11 7 ⁴ Sans teeth,
sans taste‚ sans eyeS‚ sans everything.’

455. convenit, ‘it is suitable ’ and therefore probable.

animai naturam=animamz see n. tol. 130.

456. eeu fumus: for the nom„ es. ll. 427, 614.

So Cebes (Phaedo 70 A) expresses the sear that the soul, in quittiug
the body, ὥσπερ πνεῦμα ἢ καπνὸς διασκεδασθεῖσα οἴχηται διαπτομένη.

458. fessa. is neut. plur.‚ agreeing with animam et animum under·
stood.

459—525. Again, as the body is lt'able to dakease, so the mind can feel
grief and sear, and must therefore dic too. And the mind is afficted
also by the diseas-es of the body: the poison of alcohol and the poison
os epilepsy afflet both mind and ¹ body, and both recover when the
poison has spent its firce. The very fact that the st‘ck mind, like the·
sick body, can be healed by medicine, is a proof of its mortalizy: for
heoling implies change, and an immortal thing will not submit lo
any change.. T hercfhre the sickness os tlte mind, and tho fact that
it can be cured, alike prove its mortality.

459. hue aceedit uu is used, like porro, praeterea, denique, to bring

472, 473. I accept Giussani's transposition of this couplet. Lucr.
says in effect: ‘ death is produced by mental disturbance (dolor) as well
as by physical (νηπύτιε). we have known people die from intense sear
or grief.' But the position of this statement in the uss, is inappro-
priate: sor Lucr. has there begun a fresh argument, which deals with
the effect of morbus only, and not dolor, upon the soul: there is no ,

There is certainly harshness in the double use of dolor for bodily
suffering (1. 460) and for mental suffering (1. 472); bnt Luer. is not
careful to avoid· thisz cf. the double sense of membris 11. 403, 404.

463. There is more than mere analogy: the mind is actually

affected by bodily sickness.
’ 466. aeternum = ‘ lifelong ’ ε for soporem is not ⁸ death ' but
‘coma.’
nutu...eauenu, ‘ with drooping head.’
