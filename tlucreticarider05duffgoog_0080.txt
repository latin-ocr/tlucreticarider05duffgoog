52 LUCRETIUS, 111.

used, but never ironically, by Lucr.= so in Plautus mirum ni is never
ironical, though mirum quin always is,

semina, ‘ atoms.'

227. rerum, i.e. all things that have smell or taste.
228. etiam atque otiam=‘ Ι insist ἐ cf. 11. 576, 691.

2 3 ῐ-2 57. T lte son! t's a compound substance, made up of four defferent
ingredients .· these are wind, warmffi, air, ancl a fourth which has
no name. Τ lte last is made os even smaller ancl smoother atoms
than the other three: sensation begins with it and is passed on in
order to tlze elements of warmth, wind, and air. Next the body is
afflcted, the blood first, and the bones and marrow last. But sensa·

tion does not· often reaclz the bones and marrow, or death would
follow.

The summary definition of the soul given above (1. 128) is now
expanded ; and we are told that it contains not only wind and warmth
but air and a fourth nameless substance, the most subtle and important
of all. For the quarta natura, se'e Introd. pp. xiii, xiv. So Epic.
also defined the soul (Usener l. l. p. 218) as κρᾶμα ἐκ τεττάρων, ἐκ
ποιοῦ πυρώδους, ἐκ ποιοῦ ἀερώδους, ἐκ ποιοῦ πνευματικοῦ, ἐκ τετάρτου
‘nvos' ἀκατονομάστου.

2 31. haec natura, ‘this substance‚’ i. e. ψυχή including both animus
and anima. ’

232. aura=ventust see n. to 1. 1¹22. Epicurus does not say that
this clement of the soul is wind, but that it is very like wind (προσεμφε-
ρέστατον πνεύματι).

233. vapor and calor are exact synonyms in Lucr., both meaning
‘heat.'

234. quisquam is osten used as an adj. by Lucr.

236. inter, ‘ through ’ heat.

237. mplex: it is formed of (1) aura or ventus (πνεῦμα), the
source of fear; (2) vapor (θερμότης), the source of anger3 (3) aer (ἀήρ),
the source of tranquillity: see 11. 288 soll.

aer differs from ventus in being at rest: cf. 1. 292 and vi 685 ventus
enim fit, ubi est agilando percitus aere Epicurus added this clement to
account for tranquillity (ἠρεμία) of the soul.· Another difference seems
to be of temperature, ventus being cold and aer lukewarm.

238. haee cuneta, ‘ the combination of all these’: cuncta has its
strict sense and is not merely an equivalent of omnia.
