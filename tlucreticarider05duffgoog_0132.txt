1066. gravis, ‘wearily.'

1068. mett, ‘tries to escape from?

at quem cet„ ‘but to that sels, which, of course, invariably he
cannot escape from, he remains bound against his will, and hates it... ἐ

Madvig’s flagitat (for flagi! at) is attractive= but (1) Seneca, who
quotes part of the verse, seems to have read fleg-it, ἐκ (2) the asyndeton

For the conti-ast between fugit and effugere, cf. Cic. ad ΑΗ. vii 24
non dubito quin Gnaeus· m fuga sit, modo effugiat.

1069. ingram is an adv„ of which Plautus always uses an older
form ingratiis, and also μαίειὶς-ττροῖκα.

1071. rebus relicti⁸= ceteris rebus relim‘s: osten⁰ m cornedy.

1072. naturam rerum here = φυσιολογίαν, ‘the laws of the uni-

1074. ambigitur, ‘is in question.'

The man, who has studied and believed the philosophy of EpicuruS‚
has no sear of suffering pain or privation during the infinite space of
time which will follow his death. And therefore he will be contented
during life also. Such seems to be the argument, whether convincing

The paragraph deals with vitae cupido, which is not quite the same

(1. 931 foll.) and repeats several arguments there used: cf. 1080, 1081
with 944, 945 3 1082—1084 with 957. ’

1076. dubiis ponens, ‘anxiety and peril.’

1078. certa does not mean that the time of our death is fixed by
sate, for Epicurus would deny this, but that there is no appeal against
the sentence of death.
