xxii INTRODUCTION

Lucretius uses all his powers to destroy this belief, which
in his view has no foundation and is productive only of un-
happineSS. His own gospel he does not regard as a message
of despair: on the contrary, he believes that it will bring peace
into the world, and that it alone can cure that strange disease
of the mind, which prevents even health and wealth from making
life happy ¹. He is consciouS, however, that he is fighting against
something deeply rooted in human nature: that even those who
do not believe in the punishments of hell, cannot tear out of
their hearts the instinct which makes us cling to life. 111 order
to convince such doubter5‚ he brings Nature herself upon the
scene and makes her remonstrate with her disobedient children ².
Then 110 speaks of kings and captainS, poets and philosopherS‚
none of whom escaped death, and asks what pretensions has
a mere ordinary man to be more highly favoured than the
choicest specimens of our race3. Put shortly, his message is
this: it is a fact, scientifically proved, that existence depends
upon the union of body and soul, and ceases when they are
separated: once believe this sincerely, and you will be indifferent
to the fate of your dead body3 you will cease to regard death
as a state of pain or privation3 you will not sorrow over-much
for the dead, you will be content yourself to die and make room
for a new generation ; and you will be able to concentrate your
thoughts on this life, and live it well. Seeley has characterised
Natural Religion as followst ‘As described here religion does
not brood over a future life, but is intensely occupied with
the present3 it does not surmise something behind nature, but
contemplates nature itself3 it does not worship a Power which
suspends natural laWS, but the Power which is exhibited in these
laws; it does not damp enjoyment, but is itself the principle of
all rich enjoyment ; it is not sels-conscious or sels-absorbed and
does not make us anxious about our own fate, but is the principle
which destroys self and gives us strength to rise above our

anxieties.' Every word of this description Lucretius would
have declared to be true of his own creed.
