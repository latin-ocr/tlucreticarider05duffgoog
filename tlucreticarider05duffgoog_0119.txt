NOTES. 93,-

862. Lucr. now resumes where he left off atl. 842: cf. accidere
1. 841 with accidere 1. 864. What follows has no reference to the
possibility of fiature combinations of the same atomS, so as to reproduce
the same individual.

863. esse, ‘exist.’

864. eximit, ‘precludesss

probet is a contracted form osproln'bet, like debere and praebere from
dehibere and praehibere-

865. mum, i. e. the dead man. ,

concil-iar? is much more osten used of good things, e. g. gratiam,
amorem etc„ than of bad things·

866. ln ιιιοειΊῖοπι after death.’

868. an nuno cet.= the first of the two alternatives (utrum aliquo
tempore) has to be supplied: the meaning is that for a dead man it is the
same as if he had never been born.

869. mors inmortalis: our state of non-existence will last sor
ever after our death 3 and so the period of our non-existence was infinite
before our birth; our little life counts for nothing between the two
infinitieS. Α

mors=⁴rb τεθνάναι, not τὸ ἀποθανεῖν.

870—893. Yet so persistent is this false view of death, that even
some men wlco profess to believe ζῖΙιαέ death ends sensation, are
γα ᾱιὶςίνεεεεά at the thought that their dead body may rot or be
burned or devoured by beasts. This shows that they do not really
believe what they profess to believe, but unconscioush‘ imagine-them-
selves to survive their own death, so as to feel what happens to their
dead body ,· which is, in fact, impossible. Whatever may be thefate
of our body after death, it is a matter of indfference to us.

870. videas: see n. tol. 854. ·

ae ipsum indignarier, ‘cry out against his lot ἐ a personal acc. after
indignari is very rare in place οἱ suam νεὶ-επις but Lucr. wishes to
emphasise the words, because the mistake he points out is just that of
identifying sels with the corpse.

871. posto, ‘laid in the grave)

872. interfiat, ‘be daetroyffl': a passive of interficere.

87 3. non sincerum sonere, ‘that he does not ring true ἐ a common
metaphor from earthenware vessels which ring dull if there is a flaw in
them: cf. Plato Τ heaet. 179 D σκεπτέον τὴν φερομένην ταύτην οὐσίαν,
διακρούοντα. εἴτε ὑγιὲς εἴτε σαθρὸν φθέγγεται.
