54 LUCRETIUS, 111.

256. in nummo quui corpore, ‘near the surface of the body’:
quasi is used in the sense of paene.

258-287, The next point is tlte way in whz'ch these four elements are
combined so as to produce sensation ,· but owing to the poverty qs the
Latin language‚ I can only explain this in outline. T lte atoms of
the defferent elements are inextn'cably mixed up so as to form a single
substance. As the soul is unseen and permeates the whole body,
so the nameless dement, because formed of smaller almus, is more
Qogejrom view than the other three, andpermeates the whole soul,·
it may therefoee be regarded as the soul of the soul. So the other
three elements are mixed up with one another ; any separation of
them would destroy sensation.

2 59. compta, ‘ united ': the word suggests, more than mixta does,
that the combination is regulated by fixed laws.

260. patrii sermonis egestas: at the beginning of the poem (i 139)
Lucr. makes the same complaint and excuses himself on that ground
for inventing new terminology ; it comes again (i 832) when he cannot
find a Latin equivalent for ὀμοιομέρεια. Why he repeats it here, we do
not know. Epic. may have used some technical term in this connexion,
which Lucr. would like to translate but cannot.

261. summatim, in spite of its position, seems to belong to tangam.

262. principiorum is a genitive of primordia in Lucr.: hence
princ. motibus is a more emphatic form of suis motibus. The atoms of
each element, being perpetually in motion, run in and out of the atoms
of all the other elements‚ so that no local separation (cf. spatio divisa)
of any one element is possible.

263. unum is predicate, not subject t ‘ separately.’

264. μαθων-δύναμις, ‘function.’

265. viz, ‘powers ἐ this plur. is used also ii 586.

extant: the subject is not primordia but the four elements that
compose the soul.

266. viscere, ‘flesh’: see n. to 1. 249·

268. eorporis augmen, ‘ bulk of body.'

272. The antecedent to unde is mobilis illa vis, not ollis.

273, ²74· latet, subest, and iuna ost all express the same thing:
that, supposing· a piece of soul could be examined, the quarta natura,
owing to the excessive smallness of its atoms, would be the last to
be reached by analysis. Lucr. does not mean that it is more remote
than the other substances from the surface os the body. For this
