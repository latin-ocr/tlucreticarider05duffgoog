78 LUCRETIUS, 111.

sake of argument, a hypothesis which the speaker does not admit to be
true: cf. ll. 679, 766, 843.

‘541. dare, ‘to grant.’

542. particulatim, ‘bit by bit' z cf. paulatim, membratim, tractim,
all in this paragraph. No Latin writer uses these adverbs in -im more
freely than Lucr.

544. per auras: as the argument deals entirely with the state of
tne soul before it leaves the body, it seems to me 'likely that Luer. wrote
per artus. It makes no difference, he then sayS, whether the soul dies
in separate places throughout the body or is concentrated into one part
and dies there: the man dies gradually all the same.

As to the cause of the corruption, dispersa per auras would sound
more natural to an inattentive copyist: so in chap. xiv of Cranford
edition after edition reprints ‘a little of the cold loin sliced and fried,'
though attention to the context shows that Mrs Gaskell wrote ⁴ a little
of the cold lion etc.’ The corruption arose from the fact that cold
loin is a commonet dish than cold lion. ’

545. obbrutesoet, ‘it loses feeling.’

670—678. Is the soul has existed from 'everlasting, how have we no
recollection of our former lives ? Ifyou say that the soul has fhrgvtten
its past, such a change aspersonality practically implies death. You
must therefore allow that the soul which exists in you now, did not
exist before your body.

A new group of arguments (670—783) begins here: up to this point
Lucr. has denied that the soul survives the body 3 he now denies that it
existed before the body: see n. to l. 417.

671. Cf. i 112 ignoratur mim quae sit natura animai, Ι nata sit
(i-e. whether it be mortal) an contra nascentibus insinuetur. In the
latter case it has presumably been in other bodies; the ancient theory of
immortality generally includes metempsychosis

672. super: adv„ ‘ as well.’

anteactam utatem=‘ our former lives!

673. tenemus, ⁸ remember’: all Latin poets use tenere to supply
unmetrical parts of meminisse: e. g. memini semperque tenebo.

674. For change is deathz see n. to l. 519.

675. retinentia, ‘recollection’z cs. tenemus above: the metre will
not admit either memoria or recordatio, the usual equivalents of μν-ἠμη.

676. long-tter: cf. duriter, graviter, longitem uniter: in classical
Latin such adverbs are formed only from adjectives of the grd declension.
