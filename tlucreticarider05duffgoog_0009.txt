WHEN the Syndics of the Cambridge University Press

suggested that 1 shouldedit another book of Lucretius
for their Latin serieS, the third book seemed for several
reasons the most suitable for the purpose. In it all the
different powers of Lucretius are seen at their highest3
it suffers little, if at all, by separation from the rest of the

‘ poem3 and it seems to me to have gained more than other

parts of the poem from recent criticism.

The reader, who wishes to know the main points in
which ‘the text and interpretation here put forward differ
from those os Munr0, should consult the critical notes and
the references given in the Index under the headingS,
‘Giussani,' ‘Heinze‚’ ‘Lachmann,' ‘Munro.’

Of the two last it is needless to speak: their reputation
is fixed, and their editions are classicS. The edition of
Richard Heinze (Leipzig, 1897) is a careful and learned
study of this book, in which much is done to elucidate
and illustrate the philosophy, and several passages of
importance are for the first time rightly explained. The
edition of Lucretius by Carlo Giussani (Tutin, 1896—1898),
together with his ‘Note Lucreziane’ published shortly
