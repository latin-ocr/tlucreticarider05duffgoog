NOTES. . 99

happiness was due mainly to the recollection, and therefore permanence,
of past pleasures. But in this case they have passed away leaving no
trace behind. The philosopher Attalus (cf. Sen. Epp. 72, 8) compared
such a man to a dog which instantly gulps down each bit thrown to it by
its master and gives all its attention to the next bit which it expectS,
showing no enjoyment of what it has actually got. See n. to l. ¹084·
941. in offensust: the common phrase is in qffensa esse alicui, but
Lucr. has a marked partiality for forms in -usz he uses qffensus else-⁸*

‚ where only of physical contact.

942. male, ‘to no purpose': pereat itself has this sense, but male
strengthens it.

943. cur is to be supplied stom l. 938 at the beginning of the clause.
There is no reference to suicide: Lucr. means ε ‘ why are you not content
to die Ρ ²

944, 945. Cf. Ecclesiastes i 9 ‘the thing that hath been, it is that .

which shall be 3 and that which is done is that which shall be done: and
there is no new thing under the sun.'

946. A second dilemma begins here: ‘you, who have wasted your
lise, are either young or old: in either case, be content to die.’ The
second horn of the dilemma is not included in N ature’s speech and
begins 1. 952.

948. saecla is constantly used by Lucr. as a plural of genus, mean·
ing ‘ kinds’ of living things· Thrice only (here, 1. 1090, and i 202) it
means ‘generations‚’ and denotes a period of time.

vincere, ‘to outlast.'

950. qum respondemus, ‘what answer are we to make ?’ The
indic. is used in a deliberative question when the question does not '
expect an answer: see n, to Juv. 3, 296 = here quid=nilciL

951. causam, ‘indictment.’

952. hle is the masc. pronoun.

vero, ‘but.'

954. inclamet: the subject natura is understood.

mag-1³ is to be taken with merito.

955. abhinc=hinc, ‘from here.’ It is generally used of time, not
place; but the latter meaning is required here: cf. Plautus Men. 607
aufer hinc palpationes ; Poen- 1035 maledicta hinc aufer: linguam con-
pescas face. The second quotation seems to be conclusive as to the
meaning of abhinc here: ‘from this time forth’ (so Munro) is weak,
and also a strange meaning sor the word, which is regularly used with
an acc. of time with the sense of ‘ag0.’
