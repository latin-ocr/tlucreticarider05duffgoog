46 LUCRETIUS, 111.

(of Epicurus) τὸ πᾶν παντὸς φύσιν ὀνομάζειν εἴωθε, it seems 'that be
derived this peculiarity from his revered master.
· 132. emmone, ‘ musicians ἐ the verse will not admit musicos.
Eeflooniz for a similar abl. in -i os a Greek noun, cf. tripodi i 739.
133. porro, ‘in turn.’
illam, sc. rem, which by an idiom common in Lucr. appears in the
following relative clause as subject. Lucr. says ironically that the term
was a present from the Muses to musicians: he then adds that as a
matter of fact musicians took the word from carpentry, (ἁρμονία meaning
‘joining’ originally). Epicurus insisted on the use os words in their
simple sense3 and Lucr. implies that the application of this term to the
soul is doubiy metaphorical and therefore doubly false. For this opinion
of Epicurus, see Introd. p. x, and cf. Epicurus (Usener l. l. p. 5)
ἀνάγκη τὸ πρῶτον ἐννόημα (the original sense) καθ’ ἕκαστον φθόγγον
βλέπεσθαιρ Cic. De Fin. ii 6 (os Epic.) crebro dicit, diligenter oportere
exprimi, quae vis subiecta sit vocibus.

135. habeant is used in the sense of sibi habeant, i.e. we don’t want
it: see n. to Juv. 3, 187.

136-160. The animus ancl anima are united and fhrm a single
substance. But there is this dafference between them: the animus is
the superior and is concentrated in tlte lzeart, whereas tlte anima obeys
the animus and is diffused throughout the whole body. T hough the
animus hasfielings ofpleasure or pain, independently of ,tlte anima
or the body, yet any violent emotion os the animus afflcts the anima
and eventually the body. Τ his proves the connexion between animus
and anima.

See Introd. p. xii soll. This connexion is regarded as very important;
as it excludes the view that the soul may die with the body, and the
mind nevertheless survive.

136. coniuncta, neut. plur. agreeing‘ with the masc. and fem.
nouns: cf. 1. 66.

137. inter se goes with coniuncta.

natura-ln, ‘ substance.’

140. Lucr. is translating EpicuruS‚ who is quoted by a Scholiast
(see Usener l. l. p. 21) as saying τὸ μέν τι ἄλογον αὐτῆς (i.e. τῆς ψυχῆς),
ὃ τῷ λοιπῷ παρεσπάρθαι σώματι· τὸ δὲ λογικὸν ἐν τῷ θώρακι ὡς δῆλον ἔκ
