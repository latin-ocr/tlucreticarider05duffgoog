84 LUCRETIUS, 111.

753. desiperent, ‘ would lack reason)

fera saecla ferarum is pleonastic, but gives an assonance such as
Lucr. lovesz cf. l. 746 semine seminioque.

saecla is in Lucr. the plur. os genus.

755. inmortalem is not a mere epithet but part of the hostile
argument: ‘the soul is immortal but changes....’

756. For change is death: see n. to 1. 519.

757. We have seen (11. ²90 foll.) that fear is caused by atoms of
wind in the soul and fierceness by atoms of heat: consequently, if the
brave soul of a hound becomes the frightened soul of a stag, the atoms
of wind must become more numerous or at least more prominent,
i.,e. the parts of the soul must depart from their former arrangement
(ordine migrant).

758, 759 are a digression. ‘If such change of the soul takes place
at birth, the soul is not likely to survive the death of the body.’ This has
nothing todo with the main argument.

759. denique, ⁴ in the end,' goes with intereant.

cunctae, sc. panes.

761. o sapienti stulta, like τυφλὸς ἐκ δεδορκότος. On this theory,
the soul of a child would generally come from the body of an adult:
but we do not generally find ‘old heads upon young shoulders.’

762. prudens sit, ‘has disci-enon!

763 as given in the MSS. is a repetition of 1. 746 but gives no
construction here. , ἢ

764. The theory thathuman souls keep to human bodies implies
a similar regularity in souls of other animals·

pullus, ‘a soal’z so Fr. poulain: it means ‘chicken’ (poulet) ii 927,
and ‘shoot of a tree’ v 1364.

765. tonoro=‘young.'

766. οοπῐῦεὶοιηειο confugient ut dicant: cf. the use of adducor ut
verum sit for adducor ut credam verum esse·

sl iam: see n. to 1. 540.

769. quove: see n. to 1. 34·

770. commata, ‘to grow strong and....' ,

Cf. v 847 cupitum aetatis tangere florem: the time meant is the
maturity of mind and body at the beginning of manhood: this is
taken as a typical stage of life, but the argument applies to all stages
alike.

771. origine prima refers to the first growth of the body in the
mother's womb.
