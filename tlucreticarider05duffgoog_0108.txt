82 LUCRETIUS, 111.

723. prim, ‘separately'z see u. to l. 372.

corpora are the bodies of the worms.

724. nec reputas σακε ‘leaving out of account the strange fact
that...)

725. est ut videatur=w⁹dcturz cf. 1. 715: ‘it is possible that this
may seem to need enquiry and bringing to a decision.'

727. semna quaeque, ‘the different kinds of atoms’ of which the
worms’ bodies are made. These atoms exist in the decaying body.
This picture of the souls as house-builders is of course ironical.

73ο. noque: the sentence is irregular: Lucr. begins as if he meant
to follow neque cur... by nequi quomodo 1. 736, but then puts in two
explanatory clauseS, each introduced by enim: and the statement that
such a manufacture is impossible (ll. 735, 736), takes a different turn.

noiant, sc. corpus.

ipsae, ‘of their own motion)

732. sommae: the body is a cause of pain to the soul, so that the
soul oennot desire a body· to live in. Lucr. refers to the law of Epicurus
(Usener, l. l. p. 274) φυσικῶς καὶ ἀδιδάκτως τὸ {dior φεύγει μὲν τὴν
ἀλγηδόνα, διώκει δὲ τὴν ἡδονήν.

733. his viulo is to be taken both with affine and laborat.

734. eoum ι cf. i 806 tabe* nimborum: but iv 336 contagl.

ωηατ-πάσχεις see n. to l. 168. In old Latin this verb osten
governs an acc.

735. quamvis utne, ‘as advantageous as you like: i.e. highly
advantageouS.

736. cui subeant, ‘wherein to enter’: it seems that'the clause
must express purpose, which cum subeant (so uss.) does not.

738. This begins the second horn of the dilemma. Lucr. does not
state the consequence of his dilemma: it is that these souls do not come
from without, and are therefore made of the relies of soul lest in the ·
decaying body. But if the soul leaves relies of itself behind, it is not
immortal (l. 714 soll.).

utquiz also i 755, ii 17, and (by conjecture) ii 428. The word is
common in Plautus (e.g. Capt. 553, Trin- 6 37) 2 it means no more than
ut: cf. at and atqui: the abl. case of the pronoun has become a mere
enclitic conjunction or adv. like πώς in Greek.

739. neque emm cet„ ‘ sor the souls cannot be united to the bodies
with nice precision‚ nor will the connexions essen‘tial to common sensa·

tion take place’ xxi. e. there will be neither συμπλοκή nor συμπάθεια (see
n. to l. 153) between souls and bodies.
