errat: ⁴ differs.’
678. nunc, i.e. in this lise.

679—712. The theory that our body was made first and the soul then
inserted at the moment of our birth, is at variance with the facts of
sensation. Is that were the case, we should expect the soul to live
apart within the body, in a separate compartment of its own. But

facts show that sensation, and therefore the soul, is spread over the
whole body. The soul must be born within the body ; sor its close

um'on with the body cannot be explained, isit came into the body from
without ; and the same reason prevents it from escaping uninjured
from the body at death. But you may say that the soul does
indeed come from outside into the body, but, instead of having a com-
partment to itself, is then diffused throughout the whole frome.

I reply that such diff'usion implies the destruction of the former soul
and the creation of a new one.

679. si lam: see n. tol. 540.

680. vivata. potestas, ‘vital energy’z cf. 11. 409, 558.

682. conveniebat, sc. eam vivere: ‘it ought not to live there in
such a way as to seem to bave grown... 'z i.e. because of its συμπάθεια
with the body, it does seem to have grown with it 3 but, if the theory
now attacked be true, there should not be this συμπάθεια.

683. ln ipso sang-uine, ‘actually in the blood‚’ life being popularly
supposed to depend upon the blood more than upon the limbs: cs. 1. 43.

684-686. ‘But it ought’ (on this hypothesis) ‘to live in a cage
raeerved exclusively for itself (while nevertheless the whole body is
filled with sensation); but that the very opposite takes place is shown
by plain facts.’

cnm suggests that the soul is like a bird or animal imptisoned in
the body.

sibi strengthens per se: cs. αὐτὴν καθ’ αὑτήν.

solnm, ‘unmixed.’

685. convenit. governs vivere: there is no instance in Lucr. in
which convenit is followed by ut.

convenit aster conveniebat is certainly harsh but does not seem im-
possiblez the syntax ossi solitast...‚ convenit... is quite correct.

. nt has its limiting sense: i.e. if you suppose the soul to be caged
apart, you have to sace the difficulty that the whole body has sensation.

686. quod refers only to l. 684„ not to l. 685, which is parenthetical.
