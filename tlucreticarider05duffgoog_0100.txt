74 LUCRETIUS, 111.

The same argument, more fully stated, recurs 11. 784—799. The
point of it, somewhat disguised here, is that the mind can live in one
place only, and therefore dies outside the body.

615. amm menn, ‘the reasoning of the mind,' means no more than
animust the two words are synonyms: cf. 1. 94.

616. unis: the plur. of unus is naturally rare but is used by good
writers: οἰζζ897. This ‘unvarying position' is the centre of the breast‚
i.e. the heart: see n. to l. 140.

617. omnibus is dat. masc„ ‘for all creatures': the ambiguity is
awkward but not such as Lucr. avoids.

618. cuique: each thing (not ‘part of the body’) has a fixed
environment, i-e. a place in which it must be born and in which alone
it can live.

619. quicqum has the sense of quidque: so osten in Lucr. (e.g.
1. 787) and in early Latin.

620, 621. ‘And it is ordained that a thing shall be formed os mani·
sold parts on this condition that (ita ut) the arrangement of the parts
shall never come in perverted order.' The general law that a thing can
only exist in its proper environment, is now followed by a corollary‚
that no organism can live, unless each of its different parts occupies the
place assigned to it in the organic arrangement of the parts. From
each law a conclusion follows (though' not explicitly stated by Lucr.)=
(1) the mind can exist only in the breast3 (2) since our body is an
organism of parts, the mind cannot live in any other part of the body
than the breast.

62ο. esse is governed by some phrase like sancitum est, understood
out of reddita sunt.

(The above explanation, which is given by Professor J. E. B. Mayor
and by Giussani, ‚seems to make Munro’s hypothesis of a lacuna un·
necessary.)

622. usque aden, ‘so universally.’

res, ‘effect’; rem, ‘cause’

623. Before fluminibuS, in is to be supplied from in igni.

624—633. Fur-ther, if the soul has sensciztion= apart from the body, it
must possess the organs of sensation: but these cannot exist apart
from the body; consequeretly the soul cannot have sensatim, and
therefore cannot exist, outside the body.

626. eam iaciendum est, ‘we must suppose it’: cf. 1. 878': this
- active constr. of the gerund is very common in Lucr.: cf. 1. 391.
