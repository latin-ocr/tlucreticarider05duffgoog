102 LUCRETIUS, 111.

{— of an acre. We may translate by ‘rood8,’ remembering Milton,
P. L. i ‘his other parts besides Prone on the flood, extended long and
large, Lay floating many a rood.’

992. nobis, ‘ for us.'

hie either=in vita (1. 982), or ls the masc. pronoun, ‘the man we
see.’

993. volucres is explained by anxius angor, atque being= ‘ that
is’: cf. l. 793, and the use of etii 615. But the mention of volucres
is very unpleasing here, where Lucr. is undertaking to explain away the
vultures as a mere allegory.

anxius angor is an assonance such as Lucr. loves: see n. to 1. 364.

994. The slave of any passion is a Tityus, torn by the sad thoughts
caused by the passion. Kingsley uses Ixion to denote the same thing:
‘ For ever doom’d‚ Ixion-like, to reel On mine own passions’ ever·
burning wheeL’

995. The punishment of Sisyphus was to roll a stone for ever up a
mountain: cf. Homer od. xi 593 fon.

998. nec datur umquam seems to refer to the successful candidates
as well as the defeated, so that Pompey and Caesar are Sisyphuses too,
Lucr. says: ‘power is a delusion and is never really given to any.’
Here he follows Epicurus who taught that men seek power for the
sake os safety but do not get safety thereby: see n. to l. 59. Lucr. had

seen many striking examples of this fact in the public life of his own
time.

1001. nmen, ‘after all.'

1002. The rhythm of the verse expresses the rapid fall of the
stone: cf. Od. xi 598 αὖτις ἔπειτα πέδονδε κυλίνδετο λᾶας ἀναιδής.

1003-1010. The Danaids had to pour water sor ever into a sieve
in Hades. We should expect Lucr. to say that discontented mortals
suffer the torments of the Danaids: but he gives another turn to his
interpretation, comparing the Seasons‚ which ever bring to man de-
lightsul gifts, to the Danaids, and the dissatisfied soul to their sieve.

1003. animi naturam=animumz see n. to 1. 130.

1005. quod is the relative.

The Horae were kindly goddesseS, represented in art as blooming
maidens (cf. l. 1008): they come back each year and come in a regular
order (circum).

1006. 1epores refers especially to flowerS.

1008. noemia est...quo‹1 memorant, ‘this is the meaning of the
tale they tell, that...’: for the expression, cs. l. 754 and i 1052.
