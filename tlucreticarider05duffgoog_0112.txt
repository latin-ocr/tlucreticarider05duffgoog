' 86 LUCRETIUS‚ 111.

Lucr. now resumes and develops the argument which he first touched
on at ll. 61 5—-62 3. The first 14 ll. of the paragraph are repeated almost
exactly v 128—141.

784. in aethere: i.e. the tree cannot root in the air but only in
arvtk. >·
787. quioquld=quidquez cf. 1. 619.

790. quod sl posset enlm is most unusual for hoc si cet.t enim in
a relative clause seems an undoubted solecism. Madvig, who discusses
the passage (Adv. 11 p. 23), seems to consider it as possible: he says that
enim connects the whole argument with what goes before: is this
possible? Munro’s punctuation (see critical notes) is ingenious and
gets rid of this difficulty, and of the awkward asyndeton after soleret3
but it is open to the grave objection, that what ought to be the conclu-
sion, is thus stated in the protasis.

Lucr. means this: ‘ is it were possible sor the animus to exist outside
the body, it could a fortiori exist in the head or heels: but in fact it
can exist only in the breast.' This argument is obscured by Munro’s
punctuation.

793. tandem, ‘ and at all events? tandem here approaches in
meaning to saltem: cf. Ter. Eun. 1054 perfice hoc Ι precibus pretio ut
haeream in parte aliqua tandem apud Thaidem. The word is originally
deictic, tamdem meaning ‘so much as that’: cf. the Homeric τοῖοινε
later it was restricted to a temporal sense, ‘so long as that.’

ln eodem homine, ‘in its native man’: cf. T ac. Ann. xi 16 neminem
isdem in terris ortum (‘no native of this country ’).

atque= ‘that is.' Cf. 1. 555.

794. quod, ‘ but,’ as in quod si. quod quoniam does not occur
again in Lucr.

796. amma. is used in its restricted sense, for the irrational part of
the soul: this isdiffused through the whole body.

797. durare geluque: the natural order is inverted= cf. crescat et
insit l. 787.

801. consentire=cvurdaxew, ‘feel in unison ’z see n. to l. 153.

fungi mutua, ‘be reciprocally acted upon ’: sor fungi, cf. l. 168.

mutua. is used as an adv. ε Virgil has per mutua in the same sense.

802—80 5. Soul and body are so closely blended as to form a single
thing (iunctum in concfflo): it is therefore inconceivable that one
should be exposed to the disintegrating forces here called procellae, if
the other is not. For then the combination of body and soul would be

 

both vulnerable and invulnerable, both morta} and immortal, which is ·
