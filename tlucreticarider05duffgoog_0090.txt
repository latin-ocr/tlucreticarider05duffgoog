64 LUCRE‘HUS, 111.

412. eorum, i.e. of the pupil and of the ball. Se, if all the anima
be removed, there will be an end of both anima and animus.

415. monui, ‘ otherwise‚’ though a rare wor'd in poetry, is persectly
appropriate here; to' reject the verse (so Lachmann) on that ground
seems unreasonable, and to emend it unnecessary. The addition of est
seems necessary, as Lucr. would hardly omit the verb in such a sentence.

416. vincti: vincta would be more normal: cf. 1. 1362 the masc.
plur. is regular when the nouus are names of persons: e. g. Orgetorix et
filia capti sunt.

417—444. I shall now set forth proofs· os the mortality of the soul.
(Whether I use the word animus or anima, you will understand that
I denote tlte soul by either, indifferently.) First then, I have shown
that the atoms qs the soul are smaller and have less cohesion than
the atoms eff water. But water pours away and dirnspears, when
the vessel that contains it is broken. T herefore the sonl ‚is at
once dzlrsolved into atoms, when withdrawn from the body which
contains it.

The first subject of the book is now ended, and the second begins
after a preface of eight linoe. This is the kemel of the whole poem, for
the supreme object of φυσιολογία is to demonstrate that there is no
future life, and therefore no possibility of future suffering, sor the soul.

417. 1111110 age, ‘now mark me ἐ the phrase generally marks the
beginning osa new and important theme: cf. i 265 and 921.

nativos et mortalis osse, ‘ were born and must die ’τ the one fact
implies the other, so that Lucr. often uses nativus as a synonym of
manalis. Yet both epithets are needed here: for the ancient champions
of the immortality of the soul, chiefly the Platonists and Pythagoream,
held that the life of the soul ⁶ extends backwards into the infinite past
as well as forwards into the endless 'future ’ (Archer-Hind's Phaedo
p. 19) 3 while the modern popular belief is that the soul was born, or
created, but will never die. Lucr. argues first against the immortality
of the soul (ll. 425—669), then against its pre-existence (11. 670—783).

418. levis: the epithet adds poetry to the passage and also indicates
some of the arguments which are to follow.

419. Here again the language does not suggest that Lucr. is simply
translating a popular hand-book of Epicureanism. See n. to 1. 10.

Munro believes that all the arguments are taken from one of the
37 volumina of Epicurus περὶ φύσεως.
