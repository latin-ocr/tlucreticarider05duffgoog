NOTEs 49

173.· suavis, the Mss. reading, is retained by Heinze who supports
it by two interesting quotations: Seneca Epp. 77, 9 caldo subinde
subsusd paulatim defecit, ut aiebat, non sine quadam voluptate, quam
adferre solet lenis dissolutio, non inexperta nobis quos aliquando liquit
animun Montaigne Essais ii 6 (of his fall from his horse) il me sembloit
que ma vie ne me tenoit plus qu'au bout des levres ,· je sermoy les yeulx
pour ayder, ce me sembloit, ὰ la poulser hors, et prenoy plaisir ὰ m’alanguir
et ὰ me lais-ser aller. Lucr. may have felt this sensation himself or
heard others describe it.

in terra, i.e. when the man has reached the ground.

aestus, ‘ confusion)

175. animi here includes anima: cf. l. 161.

176. corpor-012, ‘ material)

177-230. But what is the material substance os which the soul is
made? It is made os atoms which are very small and smooth
and round. This is proved by the immense rapjdz'ty of thought,
which is motion of the atoms os the animus: for the speed os atoms is
exactly proportioned to their smallne5s, smoothness, and roundness.
Secondly, the anima also is formed of very small atoms: this is proved
by the fact that the body undergoes no apparent change and loses

¹ no weight when the whole anima is withdrawn at the moment of
death.

So Epicurus (Usener l. l. p. 19) calls the soul σῶμα λεπτομερές, and
also says (ibid. p. 21 11.) that it is formed ἐξ ἀτόμων λειοτάτων καὶ στραγ-
’γυλωτ-άτων.

Giussani points out that Lucr. is not quite accurate here. In fact he
consuses atoms with molecules. A molecule of water is the smallest
particle of. water that has the qualities of water; any further division
would resolve it into atoms. According to EpicuruS‚ all atoms move
with equal speed ι the atoms of water move no faster than the atoms of .
a block of stone: see n. tol. 33: but water moves readily, because its
molecules (ὄγκοι, glomeramina) are small and smooth and round.

177. corpore, ‘material substance!

unde eonstiterit is explained in the next paragraph: constiterzt is
pres. in meaning: cf. συνέστηκε.

180. perquam is used because perminutis is not admitted by the
mette.

corporibus, ‘ atoms.’

n. L. 111. 4
