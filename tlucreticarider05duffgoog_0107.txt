710. tum, i. e. when the body was bor (ἶλῑυ-Ιὶ-ὈῬᾸᾸχῒλ

711. privata, ‘without’z cf. privata dolore, pr. periclis: in later
Latin the abl. after privari is generally οἱ an advantage, not of a dis·
advantage.

videtur, ‘is clearly’: see n. to 1. 164.

713—740. Is, when the body dies, parte'cles of soul are left in it, the
soul, having suffered diminution, cannot be immortal: if, on the
other hand, the soul departs entire, how can we account jor all the
animal lise that wc see swarming in a dccaying body? ff these new
lives come, not from remnants of the soul but from without, we
must suppose either that the souls make bodies, as dwellings for
themselves, out of the decaying substance, or that the tiny bodies are
first formed and then each tenanted by a single soul. But neither
supposition is possible.- sor (ι) a soul has nothing to gain by entering
a body and also cannot make one, (2) a soul, which enters a body
when made, cannot animate it properly.

Lucr. himself holds that the myriads of living creatures that swarm
'm a dead body are produced by spontaneoqs generation, their bodies
being made οἱ the decomposing matter, and their souls of remnants of
the soul which once animated the dead body. His answer therefore to
the question which he puts in l. 713 is, ⁸ Yes.'

713. neone, common in indirect questions, is rare in direct, aut non
being used instead, with the verb repeated. For an instance of necne,
cf. Cic. pro fiiacco 59 utrum vultis Flacco licuisse necne Ρ

715. haud erit. nt possit=haud poterin Lucr. likes such a peri·
phrasis: cf. 1. 725 ; i 620 nil erit ut distet.

The verse has caesura, because the first syll. of inmortalis is treated
as detachable.

717. amoene membru, ‘stom the untainted limbs,’ i.e. before
decomposition begins: opp. to rancenti viscere below.

Others explain, ‘with its parts uninjured’ (cf. 1. 532); but it seems ι
unlikely that Lucr. would speak of membra of the soul.

719. cadavera. is subject.

viscere, ‘flesh’z see n. to l. 249.

7²0· omi-ant, ‘exude’: this use of spirare is very bold, much
more so than ii 354 sanguinis expirans...flumen.

722. If you adopt the unreasonable view that the souls of the

worms come from without, theu you are faced by the following
dilemma.
